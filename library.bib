abstract = {Using random year-to-year variation in temperature, we document the relationship between daily temperatures and annual mortality rates and daily temperatures and annual residential energy consumption. Both relationships exhibit nonlinearities, with significant increases at the extremes of the temperature distribution. The application of these results to “business as usual” climate predictions indicates that by the end of the century climate change will lead to increases of 3 percent in the age-adjusted mortality rate and 11 percent in annual residential energy consumption. These estimates likely overstate the long-run costs, because climate change will unfold gradually allowing individuals to engage in a wider set of adaptations. (JEL I12, Q41, Q54)},

abstract = {Logan, Utah, USA, had the nation's worst air pollution on 15 January, 2004. The high concentration of PM2.5 (particulates smaller than 2.5 $\mu$m in diameter) in the air resulted from geographical, meteorological, and environmental aspects of Cache Valley. A strong inversion (increase of temperature with height) and light precipitation and/or wind were the major causes for trapping pollutants in the air. Other meteorological factors enhancing the inversion were: the prolonged high atmospheric surface pressure, a snow-covered surface which plunged temperatures to as low as - 23.6 °C on January 23rd and high reflection of solar radiation (up to about 80{\%}), which caused less solar radiation absorption during the day throughout the most part of January 2004. Among non-meteorological factors are Cache Valley's small-basin geographical structure which traps air, with no big body of water to help the air circulation (as a result of differential heating and cooling rates for land and water), motor vehicle emissions, and existence of excess ammonia gas as a byproduct of livestock manure and urine. Concentration of PM2.5 was monitored in downtown Logan. On January 15, 2004, the 24-h, filter-based concentration reached about 132.5 $\mu$g per cubic meter of air, an astonishingly high value compared to the values of 65 $\mu$g m-3 and over, indicating a health alert for everyone. These tiny particles in the air have an enormous impact on health, aggravating heart and lung disease, triggering asthma and even death. The causes of this inversion and some suggestions to alleviate the wintertime particle concentration in Cache Valley will be addressed in this article. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Extreme climatic events, such as droughts and heat stress induce anomalies in ecosystem-atmosphere CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} fluxes, such as gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (R{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eco{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}), and, hence, can change the net ecosystem carbon balance. However, despite our increasing understanding of the underlying mechanisms, the magnitudes of the impacts of different types of extremes on GPP and R{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eco{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} within and between ecosystems remain poorly predicted. Here we aim to identify the major factors controlling the amplitude of extreme event impacts on GPP, R{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eco{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, and the resulting net ecosystem production (NEP). We focus on the impacts of heat and drought and their combination. We identified hydrometeorological extreme events in consistently downscaled water availability and temperature measurements over a 30 year time period. We then used FLUXNET eddy-covariance flux measurements to estimate the CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} flux anomalies during these extreme events across dominant vegetation types and climate zones. Overall, our results indicate that short-term heat extremes increased respiration more strongly than they down-regulated GPP, resulting in a moderate reduction of the ecosystem's carbon sink potential. In the absence of heat stress, droughts tended to have smaller and similarly dampening effects on both GPP and R{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eco{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}, and, hence, often resulted in neutral NEP responses. The combination of drought and heat typically led to a strong decrease in GPP, whereas heat and drought impacts on respiration partially offset each other. Taken together, compound heat and drought events led to the strongest C sink reduction compared to any single-factor extreme. A key insight of this paper, however, is that duration matters most: for heat stress during droughts, the magnitude of impacts systematically increased with duration, whereas under heat stress without drought, the response of R{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eco{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} over time turned from an initial increase to a down-regulation after about two weeks. This confirms earlier theories that not only the magnitude but also the duration of an extreme event determines its impact. Our study corroborates the results of several local site-level case studies, but as a novelty generalizes these findings at the global scale. Specifically, we find that the different response functions of the two antipodal land-atmosphere fluxes GPP and R{\textless}sub{\textgreater}eco{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} can also result in increasing NEP during certain extreme conditions. Apparently counterintuitive findings of this kind bear great potential for scrutinizing the mechanisms implemented in state-of-the-art terrestrial biosphere models and provide a benchmark for future model development and testing.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Urban green infrastructure can help cities adapt to climate change. Spatial planning can play an important role in utilizing green infrastructure for adaptation. Yet climate change risks represent a different sort of challenge for planning institutions. This paper aims to address two issues arising from this challenge. First, it defines the concept of green infrastructure within the context of climate adaptation. Second, it identifies and puts into perspective institutional barriers to adopting green infrastructure for climate adaptation, including path dependence. We begin by arguing that there is growing confusion among planners and policy makers about what constitutes green infrastructure. Definitional ambiguity may contribute to inaction on climate change adaptation, because it muddies existing programs and initiatives that are to do with green-space more broadly, which in turn feeds path dependency. We then report empirical findings about how planners perceive the institutional challenge arising from climate change and the adoption of green infrastructure as an adaptive response. The paper concludes that spatial planners generally recognize multiple rationales associated with green infrastructure. However they are not particularly keen on institutional innovation and there is a tendency for path dependence. We propose a conceptual model that explicitly recognizes such institutional factors. This paper contributes to the literature by showing that agency and institutional dimensions are a limiting factor in advancing the concept of green infrastructure within the context of climate change adaptation.},

abstract = {Background: We estimated the effects of temperature and humidity on hospital admissions for heart disease (International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision [ICD-9] codes 390-429) and myocardial infarction (ICD-9 code 410) of persons age 65 and older in 12 U.S. cities with a wide range of climates. To account for possible delayed effects and harvesting, we examined the impact of weather up to 20 days before each admission. Methods: Poisson regression models were fitted in each city, with regression splines used to control for season and barometric pres sure. We also controlled day of the week. We estimated the effect and the lag structure of both temperature and humidity based on a distributed lag model. Findings: For cities in both hot and cold climates, we found that hospital admissions for all heart disease increased monotonically with average temperature on the same day as and the day before admission. The effect of very high temperatures had a temporal pattem consistent with harvesting: several days after an episode of high temperature, there were fewer admissions. In contrast, a pro tective effect of cold temperature persisted without rebound. The effects of either hot or cold temperature disappeared within 10 days of exposure. There was no evidence for a humidity effect. Similar but smaller effects of temperature were seen for admissions for myocardial infarction specifically. Conclusions: The effects of temperature on hospital admissions predominantly occur within a few days after exposure, and much of the effect of hot temperatures is short-term displacement of events.},

abstract = {The DART (discrete anisotropic radiative transfer) model simulates radiative transfer in heterogeneous 3-D scenes that may comprise different landscape features; i.e., leaves, grass, trunks, water, soil. The scene is divided into a rectangular cell matrix, i.e., building block for simulating larger scenes. Cells are parallelipipedic. Their optical properties are represented by individual scattering phase functions that are directly input into the model or are computed with optical and structural characteristics of elements within the cell. Radiation scattering and propagation are simulated with the exact kernel and discrete ordinate approaches; any set of discrete direction can be selected. In addition to topography and hot spot, leaf specular and first-order polarization mechanisms are modeled. Two major iterative steps are distinguished: 1) Cell illumination with direct sun radiation: Within cell multiple scattering is accurately simulated. 2) Interception and scattering of previously scattered radiation: Atmospheric radiation, possibly anisotropic, is input at this stage. Multiple scattering is stored as spherical harmonics expansions, for reducing computer memory constraints. The model iterates on step 2, for all cells, and stops with the energetic equilibrium. Two simple accelerating techniques can be used: 1) Gauss Seidel method, i.e., simulation of scattering with radiation already scattered at the iteration stage, and (2) decrease of the spherical harmonics expansion order with the iteration order. Moreover, convergence towards the energetic equilibrium is accelerated with an exponential fitting technique. This model predicts the bidirectional reflectance distribution function of 3- D canopies. Radiation components associated with leaf volume and surface mechanisms are distinguished. It gives also the radiation regime within canopies, for further determination of 3-D photosynthesis rates and primary production. Accurate modeling of multiple scattering within cells, combined with the fact that cells can have different x,y,z dimensions, is well adapted to remote sensing based studies, i.e., scenes with large dimensions. The model was successfully tested with homogeneous covers. Preliminary comparisons of simulated reflectance images with remotely acquired spectral images of a 3-D heterogeneous forest cover stressed the usefulness of the DART model for conducting studies with remotely acquired information.},

Development intensity zones based on {\%}ISA are defined for each urban area emanating outward from the urban core to the non-urban rural areas nearby and used to stratify sampling for land surface temperatures and NDVI. Sampling is further constrained by biome and elevation to insure objective intercomparisons between zones and between cities in different biomes permitting the definition of hierarchically ordered zones that are consistent across urban areas in different ecological setting and across scales. We find that ecological context significantly influences the amplitude of summer daytime UHI (urban-rural temperature difference) the largest (8 ??C average) observed for cities built in biomes dominated by temperate broadleaf and mixed forest. For all cities combined, ISA is the primary driver for increase in temperature explaining 70{\%} of the total variance in LST. On a yearly average, urban areas are substantially warmer than the non-urban fringe by 2.9 ??C, except for urban areas in biomes with arid and semiarid climates. The average amplitude of the UHI is remarkably asymmetric with a 4.3 ??C temperature difference in summer and only 1.3 ??C in winter. In desert environments, the LST's response to ISA presents an uncharacteristic "U-shaped" horizontal gradient decreasing from the urban core to the outskirts of the city and then increasing again in the suburban to the rural zones. UHI's calculated for these cities point to a possible heat sink effect. These observational results show that the urban heat island amplitude both increases with city size and is seasonally asymmetric for a large number of cities across most biomes. The implications are that for urban areas developed within forested ecosystems the summertime UHI can be quite high relative to the wintertime UHI suggesting that the residential energy consumption required for summer cooling is likely to increase with urban growth within those biomes.},

abstract = {A methodology is proposed to analyze the radiative and thermal exchanges between a small urban neighborhood and the atmosphere based on the use of the thermoradiative model SOLENE and radiometric measurements to optimize the effective values of its constant parameters. Applied to the center of Toulouse, France, the optimization data are building surface temperatures measured with handheld radiometers and a downward-facing pyranometer during one of the intense observation periods of the CAnopy and Particles Interactions in TOulouse Urban Layer (CAPITOUL) experimental campaign. The quality of the simulations is assessed by comparing, without any other model adjustment, the model outputs for two diurnal cycles (1 day in summer and 1 day in winter) against two independent experimental datasets from fixed permanent radiometers and from sensors measuring the solar, infrared and sensible heat fluxes to the atmosphere at the top of a mast 30 m above the roofs. These simulations allow us to further analyze the separate contributions of the different surface classes, roofs, facades and pavement to these fluxes and to compare them with their counterparts observed over a neighborhood of Marseilles city center during a previous experiment. The partition is remarkably similar in Toulouse and Marseilles: 6–7{\%} for the solar radiation, 73–76{\%} for the infrared radiation and 17–20{\%} for the sensible heat flux. The contribution of roofs to the infrared flux appears proportional to their plan area proportion (built density) but not the contributions to the other two fluxes. The contributions of facades to all three fluxes are roughly proportional to their fraction of the total surface area.},

abstract = {Aims: The field of ecohydrology is providing new theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches for understanding the complex interactions and feedbacks between vegetation and hydrologic flows at multiple scales. Here we review some of the major scientific and technological advances in ecohydrology as related to understanding the mechanisms by which plant–water relations influence water fluxes at ecosystem, watershed and landscape scales. Important Findings: We identify several cross-cutting themes related to the role of plant– water relations in the ecohydrological literature, including the contrasting dynamics of water-limited and water-abundant ecosystems, transferring information about water fluxes across scales, understanding spatiotemporal heterogeneity and complexity, ecohydrological triggers associated with threshold behavior and shifts between alternative stable states and the need for long-term data sets at multiple scales. We then show how these themes are embedded within three key research areas where improved understanding of the linkages between plant–water relations and the hydrologic cycle have led to important advances in the field of ecohydrology: upscaling water fluxes from the leaf to the watershed and landscape, effects of plant–soil interactions on soil moisture dynamics and controls exerted by plant water use patterns and mechanisms on streamflow regime. In particular, we highlight several pressing environmental challenges facing society today where ecohydrology can contribute to the scientific knowledge for developing sound management and policy solutions.We conclude by identifying key challenges and opportunities for advancing contributions of plant–water relations research to ecohydrology in the future.},

abstract = {The earth's near surface air temperature is important in a variety of applications including for quantifying global warming. We analyze 6 monthly series of atmospheric temperatures from 1880 to 2012, each produced with different methodologies. We first estimate the relative error by systematically determining how close the different series are to each other, the error at a given time scale is quantified by the root mean square fluctuations in the pairwise differences between the series as well as between the individual series and the average of all the available series. By examining the differences systematically from months to over a century, we find that the standard short range correlation assumption is untenable, that the differences in the series have long range statistical dependencies and that the error is roughly constant between 1 month and one century---over most of the scale range, varying between {\{}$\backslash$textpm{\}}0.03 and {\{}$\backslash$textpm{\}}0.05 K. The second part estimates the absolute measurement errors. First we make a stochastic model of both the true earth temperature and then of the measurement errors. The former involves a scaling (fractional Gaussian noise) natural variability term as well as a linear (anthropogenic) trend. The measurement error model involves three terms: a classical short range error, a term due to missing data and a scale reduction term due to insufficient space--time averaging. We find that at 1 month, the classical error is ≈{\{}$\backslash$textpm{\}}0.01 K, it decreases rapidly at longer times and it is dominated by the others. Up to 10--20 years, the missing data error gives the dominate contribution to the error: 15{\{}$\backslash$thinspace{\}}{\{}$\backslash$textpm{\}}{\{}$\backslash$thinspace{\}}10{\{}{\%}{\}} of the temperature variance; at scales {\textgreater}10 years, the scale reduction factor dominates, it increases the amplitude of the temperature anomalies by 11{\{}$\backslash$thinspace{\}}{\{}$\backslash$textpm{\}}{\{}$\backslash$thinspace{\}}8{\{}{\%}{\}} (these uncertainties quantify the series to series variations). Finally, both the model itself as well as the statistical sampling and analysis techniques are verified on stochastic simulations that show that the model well reproduces the individual series fluctuation statistics as well as the series to series fluctuation statistics. The stochastic model allows us to conclude that with 90{\{}{\%}{\}} certainty, the absolute monthly and globally averaged temperature will lie in the range −0.109 to 0.127 {\{}$\backslash$textdegree{\}}C of the measured temperature. Similarly, with 90{\{}{\%}{\}} certainty, for a given series, the temperature change since 1880 is correctly estimated to within {\{}$\backslash$textpm{\}}0.108 of its value.},

Simulations of the diurnal pattern of slope winds under weak synoptic conditions are presented in a valley of depth 500 m and floor width 1200 m. Typical up- and downslope wind circulations are reproduced, and their influence on the stability in the valley is analyzed and characterized using the classifications of Whiteman. A systematic investigation of the inversion- layer characteristics in a set of 24 valleys of varying depth and width is conducted. For the narrow-valley cases, the depth and lifetime of the stable layer increase as the depth of the valley increases. For wide valleys, however, the stable-layer depth and lifetime converge toward a single value regardless of the valley depth. An original subroutine accounting for topographic shading is introduced and its effects on both the slope winds and the inversion breakup process are discussed. Results from tests in idealized valleys indicate that topographic shading can delay inversion- layer breakup and, therefore, should be included, when appropriate, in numerical simulations of flow over complex terrain.},

So, it has been very necessary and urgent to know the affection trend and extent of the urban heat island to high temperature in urban during that period. The temperature data measured at automatic weather stations was used to statistic the urban heat island. High resolute numeric model was used to simulate the urban heat island distribution and its influences to high temperature. The researches showed that there was a clear urban heat island phenomenon in Chongqing. The average of the daily urban heat island intensity in the summer was 1.0degC and the maximal reached 1.8degC. The urban heat island intensity varied clearly in a day. It was stronger in nighttime than it was in daytime. The average of night urban heat island intensity in summer was 1.4degC and the maximal reached 2.6degC. The appearance of urban heat island probably increased the high temperature harm at night. The refined temperature distribution and numerical simulating results clearly showed the temperature and the urban heat island distribution. The results indicated that the temperature and the urban heat island were affected by the city zone, hills and rivers, etc, at the same time. The highest heat island was located in Shapingba district, east of Zhongliang hill, which was mainly because of dense buildings, industries and isolated wind velocity field in it. Along the river area of Jiangbei, Yuzhong, Nanan, Jiulongpo, Dadukou formed connected high heat island areas, which were all old districts with high urbanization. The high temperature harm in night in urban increased by the urban heat island.},

The code is easily used, runs quickly and provides the user with a wide variety of atmospheric models and options. Its spectral resolution is 20 1/cm Full Width/Half Maximum (FWHM) with calculations being done in 5 1/cm increments. This report describes work done to increase LOWTRAN's spectral resolution from 20 to 2 1/cm (FWHM). Specifically, the technical objectives for this program were: 1) to develop algorithms providing 2 1/cm resolution (FWHM); 2) to model molecular absorption of atmospheric molecules as a function of temperature and pressure; 3) to calculate band model parameters for twelve LOWTRAN molecular species; and 4) to integrate the LOWTRAN 7 capabilities into the new algorithms, maintaining compatibility with the multiple scattering option. MODTRAN, the final product of this effort, is a moderate resolution LOWTRAN code. Molecular absorption is calculated in 1 1/cm spectral bins, while the other parts of the calculation remain unchanged. The molecular species affected are: water vapor, carbon dioxide, ozone, nitrous oxide, carbon monoxide, methane, oxygen, nitric oxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ammonia and nitric acid.},

For single channel sensors, atmospheric corrections are generally performed using atmospheric radiative transfer models such as MODTRAN 3.5 along with radiosoundings. A sensitivity study was performed using MODTRAN 3.5 simulations to assess the accuracy of the processing regarding the experimental context. It was shown that the local topography and the atmosphere spatial variability could affect significantly the radiosounding representativeness, whereas the fluctuations of the flight altitude around the nominal value induced non-negligible inaccuracies. Moreover, using a broadband sensor induced non-linear effects that required a second order correction and also the use of look-up tables to reduce computation time. A theoretical error was next proposed to account for both the sensor accuracy and the experimental uncertainties considered when performing the sensitivity study. This theoretical error was about 1°C, and agreed well with the results obtained when validating against field measurements.},

abstract = {An urban surface scheme for atmospheric mesoscale models is presented. A generalization of local canyon geometry is defined instead of the usual bare soil formulation currently used to represent cities in atmospheric models. This allows refinement of the radiative budgets as well as momentum, turbulent heat and ground fluxes. The scheme is aimed to be as general as possible, in order to represent any city in the world, for any time or weather condition (heat island cooling by night, urban wake, water evaporation after rainfall and snow effects). Two main parts of the scheme are validated against published data. Firstly, it is shown that the evolution of the model-predicted fluxes during a night with calm winds is satisfactory, considering both the longwave budget and the surface temperatures. Secondly, the original shortwave scheme is tested off-line and compared to the effective albedo of a canyon scale model. These two validations show that the radiative energy input to the urban surface model is realistic. Sensitivity tests of the model are performed for one-year simulation periods, for both oceanic and continental climates. The scheme has the ability to retrieve, without ad hoc assumptions, the diurnal hysteresis between the turbulent heat flux and ground heat flux. It reproduces the damping of the daytime turbulent heat flux by the heat storage flux observed in city centres. The latent heat flux is negligible on average, but can be large when short time scales are considered (especially after rainfall). It also suggests that in densely built areas, domestic heating can overwhelm the net radiation, and supply a continuous turbulent heat flux towards the atmosphere. This becomes very important in winter for continental climates. Finally, a comparison with a vegetation scheme shows that the suburban environment can be represented with a bare soil formulation for large temporal or spatial averages (typical of global climatic studies), but that a surface scheme dedicated to the urban surface is necessary when smaller scales are considered: town meteorological forecasts, mesoscale or local studies.},

It represents a range of environmental hazards and will affect populations where the current burden of climate-sensitive disease is high - such as the urban poor in low- and middle-income countries. Understanding the current impact of weather and climate variability on the health of urban populations is the first step towards assessing future impacts. In this paper, we have reviewed the scientific evidence for the effects of temperature, rainfall and extreme events on human health, in particular the impacts of heat waves and floods. The methods for assessing the risks of climate change are undergoing development, and there is a need to shift the focus from global and regional to local studies. Sectoral approaches to climate change impact assessments often ignore the effects on health. There is a need to better describe the risks to health from extreme weather events as well as improve the effectiveness of public health interventions. Improving the resilience of cities to climate change also requires improvements in the urban infrastructure, but such improvements may not be achieved quickly enough to avoid an increased burden of disease due to global climate change.},

Large-scale climate anomalies captured by ENSO (NI{\~{N}}O3.4) and IPO indexes had combined effects on widespread fires. Superposed epoch analysis revealed that widespread fires on BPK occurred during years that were drier than average and when constructive phases (years of combined warm [positive] or cool [negative] phases) of ENSO and the IPO occurred three years and one year prior to fires. Positive phases of the PDO were also significantly associated with widespread fires three years prior to events, but the PDO was not influential one year prior to fires. Although fire years were temporally synchronous between the two islands during the period between 1818 and 1924 (n= 10), we did not find significant relationships between climate and fire on the smaller NNK, which suggests that island size influences the ability to detect broad-scale climate forcing of wildfires in the Florida Keys.

The Mitigation Impact Screening Tool (MIST) then extrapolates results from a suite of simulations for 20 cities to estimate air temperature changes associated with the specified changes in surface characteristics for the selected city. Alternatively the user can simply define a nominal air temperature reduction that they hope to achieve with an unspecified mitigation scenario. These air temperature changes are then input to energy and ozone models to estimate the impact that the mitigation action may have on the selected city. The results presented by MIST include a high degree of uncertainty and are intended only as a first-order estimate that urban planners can use to assess the viability of heat island mitigation strategies for their cities. As appropriate, MIST analyses should be supplemented by more detailed modeling. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A vegetation-impervious surface-soil (V-I-S) model is presented as a possible basis for standardization. The V-I-S model may serve as a foundation for characterizing urban/near-urban environments universally, and for comparison of urban morphology within and between cities. Inasmuch as the model may be driven by satellite digital data, it may serve as a global model of urban ecosystem analysis and comparison world-wide. The V-I-S model may prove useful for urban change detection and growth modelling, for environmental impact analysis from urbanization, for energy- and water-related investigations, and for certain dimensions of human ecosystem analysis of the city as well.},

abstract = {With 69{\%} of the world's population predicted to live in cities by 2050, modification to local climates, in particular Urban Heat Islands (UHIs), have become a well studied phenomenon. However, few studies have considered how horizontal winds modify the spatial pattern in a process named Urban Heat Advection (UHA) and this is most likely due to a lack of highly spatially resolved observational data. For the first time, this study separates the two-dimensional advection-induced UHI component, including its pattern and magnitude, from the locally heated UHI component using a unique dataset of urban canopy temperatures from 29 weather stations (3 km resolution) recorded over 20 months in Birmingham, United Kingdom. The results show that the mean contribution of UHA to the warming of areas downwind of the city can be up to 1.2 °C. Using the inverse Normalized Difference Vegetation Index as a proxy for urban fraction, an upwind distance at which the urban fraction has the strongest correlation with UHA was demonstrated to be between 4 and 12 km. Overall, these findings suggest that urban planning and risk management needs to additionally consider UHA. However, more fundamentally, it highlights the importance of careful interpretation of long- term meteorological records taken near cities when they are used to assess global warming.},

abstract = {Cities measure the structure and function of their urban forest resource to optimize forest management and the provision of ecosystem services. Measurements made using plot sampling methods yield useful results including citywide or land-use level estimates of species counts, leaf area, biomass, and air pollution reduction. However, these quantities are statistical estimates made over large areas and thus are not spatially explicit. Maps of forest structure and function at the individual tree crown scale can enhance management decision-making and improve understanding of the spatial distribution of ecosystem services relative to humans and infrastructure. In this research we used hyperspectral imagery and waveform lidar data to directly map urban forest species, leaf area index (LAI), and carbon storage in downtown Santa Barbara, California. We compared these results to estimates produced using field-plot sampling and the i-Tree Eco model. Remote sensing methods generally reduced uncertainty in species-level canopy cover estimates compared to field-plot methods. This was due to high classification accuracy for species with large canopies (e.g., Platanus racemosa with ∼90{\%} average accuracy, Pinus pinea at ∼93{\%}, Quercus agrifolia at ∼83{\%}) and high standard error of the plot-based estimates due to the uneven distribution of canopy throughout the city. Average LAI in canopy, based on lidar measurements was 4.47 while field measurements and allometry resulted in an LAI of 5.57. Citywide carbon storage, based on lidar measurements and allometry was estimated at 50,991 metric tons (t) and 55,900t from plot-sampling. As others have noted, carbon density varied substantially by development intensity based largely on differences in fractional cover but less so when only evaluating canopy biomass. Using separate biomass equations for each leaf type (broadleaf, needleleaf, palm) resulted in a more accurate carbon map but a less accurate citywide estimate.},

We found that the nighttime atmospheric and surface UHIs referenced to rural cropland stations exhibited significant seasonal cycles, with the highest in winter. However, the seasonal variations in the nighttime UHIs referenced to mountainous forest stations were negligible, because mountainous forests have a higher nighttime Ts in winter and a lower nighttime Ta in summer than rural croplands. Daytime surface UHIs showed strong seasonal cycles, with the highest in summer. The daytime atmospheric UHIs exhibited a similar but less seasonal cycle under clear-sky conditions, which was not apparent under cloudy-sky conditions. Atmospheric UHIs in urban parks were higher in daytime. Nighttime atmospheric UHIs are influenced by energy stored in urban materials during daytime and released during nighttime. The stronger anthropogenic heat release in winter causes atmospheric UHIs to increase with time during winter nights, but decrease with time during summer nights. The percentage of impervious surfaces is responsible for 49{\%}–54{\%} of the nighttime atmospheric UHI variability and 31{\%}–38{\%} of the daytime surface UHI variability. However, the nighttime surface UHI was nearly uncorrelated with the percentage of impervious surfaces around the urban stations.},

@article{Hoerling1997,
abstract = {The paradigm of an atmospheric system varying linearly with respect to extreme phases of the EI Nino-Southern Oscillation is questioned. It is argued that the global response to tropical Pacific sea surface temperature forcing will be inherently nonlinear. A physical basis far this intrinsic nonlinearity is the thermodynamic control on deep convection. Climate statistics for warm and cold events of the tropical Pacific are analyzed separately for the northern winter periods during 1950-96. Composite analysis of 500-mb heights reveal planetary-scale teleconnection patterns, as noted in earlier studies. A new result is the evidence for an appreciable 35 degrees longitude phase shift between the warm and cold event circulation composites, and the two wave trains appear to have different tropical origins. A large nonlinear component in North American surface climate anomalies is also found, which is consistent with such a phase shift in teleconnections. In the Tropics, rainfall anomalies also show evidence of nonlinear behavior. The maximum rain anomalies along the equator are located east of the date line during warm events, but west of the date line during cold events. The interpretation of this behavior is complicated, however, by the fact that composite warm event SST anomalies are not the exact inverse of their cold event counterparts. Idealized atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) experiments are performed in order to test the question of whether the observed nonlinearity is an intrinsic property of the atmospheric system. The model is forced with a composite SST anomaly that undergoes a realistic seasonally varying ENSO life cycle, as described by E. Rasmusson and T. Carpenter. Both positive and negative phases of the SST anomaly are used, and a 40-member ensemble of warm and cold event model simulations is conducted. A nonlinear climate response in the AGCM is found that closely resembles the observed composites, including a shift in the equatorial positions of the maxmium rain responses and a phase shift of teleconnection patterns in the upper troposphere. Barotropic model experiments indicate that the inherent nonlinearity in the tropical rain response may itself be responsible for the phase shift in the extratropical teleconnection patterns.},

abstract = {Surface temperature is a key variable in boundary-layer meteorology and is typically acquired by remote observation of emitted thermal radiation. However, the three-dimensional structure of cities complicates matters: uneven solar heating of urban facets produces an “effective anisotropy” of surface thermal emission at the neighbourhood scale. Remotely-sensed urban surface temperature varies with sensor view angle as a consequence. The authors combine a microscale urban surface temperature model with a thermal remote sensing model to predict the effective anisotropy of simplified neighbourhood configurations. The former model provides detailed surface temperature distributions for a range of “urban” forms, and the remote sensing model computes aggregate temperatures for multiple view angles. The combined model's ability to reproduce observed anisotropy is evaluated against measurements from a neighbourhood in Vancouver, Canada. As in previous modeling studies, anisotropy is underestimated. Addition of moderate coverages of small (sub-facet scale) structure can account for much of the missing anisotropy. Subsequently, over 1900 sensitivity simulations are performed with the model combination, and the dependence of daytime effective thermal anisotropy on diurnal solar path (i.e., latitude and time of day) and blunt neighbourhood form is assessed. The range of effective anisotropy, as well as the maximum difference from nadir-observed brightness temperature, peak for moderate building-height-to-spacing ratios (H/W), and scale with canyon (between-building) area; dispersed high-rise urban forms generate maximum anisotropy. Maximum anisotropy increases with solar elevation and scales with shortwave irradiance. Moreover, it depends linearly on H/W for H/W {\textless} 1.25, with a slope that depends on maximum off-nadir sensor angle. Decreasing minimum brightness temperature is primarily responsible for this linear growth of maximum anisotropy. These results allow first order estimation of the minimum effective anisotropy magnitude of urban neighbourhoods as a function of building-height-to-spacing ratio, building plan area density, and shortwave irradiance. Finally, four “local climate zones” are simulated at two latitudes. Removal of neighbourhood street orientation regularity for these zones decreases maximum anisotropy by 3{\%}–31{\%}. Furthermore, thermal and radiative material properties are a weaker predictor of anisotropy than neighbourhood morphology. This study is the first systematic evaluation of effective anisotropy magnitude and causation for urban landscapes.},

Many prevalent human diseases are linked to climate fluctuations, from cardiovascular mortality and respiratory illnesses due to heatwaves, to altered transmission of infectious diseases and malnutrition from crop failures. Uncertainty remains in attributing the expansion or resurgence of diseases to climate change, owing to lack of long-term, high-quality data sets as well as the large influence of socio-economic factors and changes in immunity and drug resistance. Here we review the growing evidence that climate-health relationships pose increasing health risks under future projections of climate change and that the warming trend over recent decades has already contributed to increased morbidity and mortality in many regions of the world. Potentially vulnerable regions include the temperate latitudes, which are projected to warm disproportionately, the regions around the Pacific and Indian oceans that are currently subjected to large rainfall variability due to the El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation sub-Saharan Africa and sprawling cities where the urban heat island effect could intensify extreme climatic events.},

For single channel sensors, atmospheric corrections are generally performed using atmospheric radiative transfer models such as MODTRAN 3.5 along with radiosoundings. A sensitivity study was performed using MODTRAN 3.5 simulations to assess the accuracy of the processing regarding the experimental context. It was shown that the local topography and the atmosphere spatial variability could affect significantly the radiosounding representativeness, whereas the fluctuations of the flight altitude around the nominal value induced non-negligible inaccuracies. Moreover, using a broadband sensor induced non-linear effects that required a second order correction and also the use of look-up tables to reduce computation time. A theoretical error was next proposed to account for both the sensor accuracy and the experimental uncertainties considered when performing the sensitivity study. This theoretical error was about 1°C, and agreed well with the results obtained when validating against field measurements.},

Anthropogenic heat and moisture emissions vary significantly both in time and space, and are not readily measured. As a result, detailed models of these emissions are not commonly available for most cities. Furthermore, most attempts to quantify anthropogenic emissions have focused on the sensible heat component, largely ignoring moisture emissions and invoking assumptions - such as the equivalence of energy consumption and anthropogenic sensible heating - which limit the accuracy of the resulting anthropogenic heating estimates. This paper provides a historical perspective of the development of models of energy consumption in the urban environment and the associated anthropogenic impacts on the urban energy balance.

abstract = {The paper addresses the question of whether the modeling practice of summing separate land-cover tiles to give urban fluxes at the neighborhood scale has merit. A central-city site in Basel, Switzerland, was instrumented to measure turbulent sensible heat fluxes QH from the two main land-cover types (roofs and canyons) separately and from the whole neighborhood. Path-averaged QH values were measured in the roughness sublayer (RSL) using scintillometry, and the spatially averaged QH neighborhood-scale flux was measured in the inertial sublayer (ISL) by an eddy-covariance system. The roof and canyon flux results are combined and weighted according to the respective plan-area abundance of each to give an estimated value of the neighborhood flux. The results show that this “bottom up” approach underestimates the measured ISL values by about 25{\%} when averaged across all periods and wind directions. This finding led to consideration of possible errors from instrumentation, inappropriate turbulent source areas, failure to sample representative surfaces, and inability to fully capture RSL heat exchange. Sorting data by the two main wind directions revealed significant differences. The measured fluxes in the ISL and across the canyon top depend little upon wind direction, but daytime roof values show a marked sensitivity to wind direction. Qualitative analysis suggests this might be caused by systematic controls such as solar angle, site morphometry, and observational setup. The comparison of bottom up versus ISL is inconclusive; in some conditions agreement appears promising, and in others it does not. The question has not been proven or disproven. It may be too ambitious to test the concept at a real-world site.},

abstract = {Turf-grass lawns are ubiquitous in the United States. However direct measurements of land–atmosphere fluxes using the eddy-covariance method above lawn ecosystems are challenging due to the typically small dimensions of lawns and the heterogeneity of land use in an urbanised landscape. Given their typically small patch sizes, there is the potential that CO2 fluxes measured above turf-grass lawns may be influenced by nearby CO2 sources such as passing traffic. In this study, we report on two years of eddy-covariance flux measurements above a 1.5 ha turf-grass lawn in which we assess the contribution of nearby traffic emissions to the measured CO2 flux. We use winter data when the vegetation was dormant to develop an empirical estimate of the traffic effect on the measured CO2 fluxes, based on a parametrised version of a three-dimensional Lagrangian footprint model and continuous traffic count data. The CO2 budget of the ecosystem was adjusted by 135gCm−2 in 2007 and by 134gCm−2 in 2008 to determine the natural flux, even though the road crossed the footprint only at its far edge. We show that bottom-up flux estimates based on CO2 emission factors of the passing vehicles, combined with the crosswind-integrated footprint at the distance of the road, agreed very well with the empirical estimate of the traffic contribution that we derived from the eddy-covariance measurements. The approach we developed may be useful for other sites where investigators plan to make eddy-covariance measurements on small patches within heterogeneous landscapes where there are significant contrasts in flux rates. However, we caution that the modelling approach is empirical and will need to be adapted individually to each site.},

abstract = {High resolution maps of urban vegetation and biomass are powerful tools for policy-makers and community groups seeking to reduce rates of urban runoff, moderate urban heat island effects, and mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas emissions. We developed a very high resolution map of urban tree biomass, assessed the scale sensitivities in biomass estimation, compared our results with lower resolution estimates, and explored the demographic relationships in biomass distribution across the City of Boston. We integrated remote sensing data (including LiDAR-based tree height estimates) and field-based observations to map canopy cover and aboveground tree carbon storage at {\~{}}1m spatial scale. Mean tree canopy cover was estimated to be 25.5±1.5{\%} and carbon storage was 355Gg (28.8MgCha-1) for the City of Boston. Tree biomass was highest in forest patches (110.7MgCha-1), but residential (32.8MgCha-1) and developed open (23.5MgCha-1) land uses also contained relatively high carbon stocks. In contrast with previous studies, we did not find significant correlations between tree biomass and the demographic characteristics of Boston neighborhoods, including income, education, race, or population density. The proportion of households that rent was negatively correlated with urban tree biomass (R2=0.26, p=0.04) and correlated with Priority Planting Index values (R2=0.55, p=0.001), potentially reflecting differences in land management among rented and owner-occupied residential properties. We compared our very high resolution biomass map to lower resolution biomass products from other sources and found that those products consistently underestimated biomass within urban areas. This underestimation became more severe as spatial resolution decreased. This research demonstrates that 1) urban areas contain considerable tree carbon stocks; 2) canopy cover and biomass may not be related to the demographic characteristics of Boston neighborhoods; and 3) that recent advances in high resolution remote sensing have the potential to improve the characterization and management of urban vegetation.},

abstract = {Complex urban environments with diverse urban canyon structures and building materials mixed with human-modified green space substantially influence the directional variation in upwelling thermal radiance. The thermal anisotropy at a satellite pixel scale (e.g. 1 km) is hard to quantify with current techniques through airborne observations and modeling. The various anisotropic features over urban and rural surfaces lead to an uncertainty regarding how this anisotropy of land surface temperature (LST) influences estimates of the surface urban heat island (SUHI). We quantify LST anisotropy over Chicago and New York using MODIS LST products during the warm months (May-September) for a 10-year period. The impacts of atmospheric attenuation and daily weather variability on LST are removed in order to isolate the anisotropic signal. We then calculate the anisotropy for different levels of urban land use intensity. The daytime maximum anisotropic effects can be up to 9 K for the most urbanized areas, while the nighttime anisotropic effects are weaker but still discernible. Two anisotropic "hot spot" features are observed during daytime: one corresponds to the sensor-sun geometric effect with a higher proportion of sunlit surface components been seen a given view configuration, and the other occurs when sensor zenith angles are near nadir in the afternoon. Similar anisotropic features between the two cities confirm the broader applicability of our approach, while some unique features specific to each city emphasize that diverse urban surface properties and geographic settings can affect anisotropy. This study is the first of its kind to directly evaluate the influence of directional anisotropy on satellite-retrieved SUHI measurements, demonstrating that anisotropic effects can possibly modify the SUHI as measured with MODIS LST by 2.3 K, which is about 25 - 50{\%} of the total magnitude of the SUHI over Chicago and New York. Our findings provide a statistical basis for the quantification of satellite-retrieved LST anisotropy over heterogeneous urban environments globally.},

abstract = {Thermal infrared emissivity is an important parameter both for surface characterization and for atmospheric correction methods. Mapping the emissivity from satellite data is therefore a very important question to solve. The main problem is the coupling of the temperature and emissivity effects in the thermal radiances. Several methods have been developed to obtain surface emissivity from satellite data. In this way we proposed a theoretical model that relates the emissivity to the NDVI (normalized difference vegetation index) of a given surface and explains the experimental behavior observed by van de Griend and Owe. We can use it to obtain the emissivity in any thermal channel, but in this work we have focused on the 10.5- to 12.5-$\mu$m region, where most thermal sensors on board satellites work at present. The model is applicable to areas with several soil and vegetation types and where the vegetation cover changes. From the theoretical model we have developed an operational methodology to obtain the effective emissivity combining satellite images and field measurements. The error of the methodology ranges from 0.5{\%} (due to the experimental limitations of the field methods) to 2{\%} (considering the case in which we have no information about the studied area). To check the general validity of the model, we have validated and applied it in different atmospheric environments and in areas with a different degree of roughness, i.e., from midlatitude (France, Argentina) to tropical (Sahel, Botswana) atmospheres, and from flat (La Mancha, Spain) to rough (Valencia, Spain) surfaces, and we have obtained an error of estimate of 0.6{\%} on the emissivity.},

In all diurnal cycles, daytime UHIs varied significantly but night-time UHIs were stable. Heating/cooling rates, surface energy balance, and local land use and land cover contributed to the diurnal variations in UHI. Partial analysis shows that diurnal temperature range had the most significant influence on UHI, while strong negative correlations were found between UHI signature and urban and rural differences in the normalized difference vegetation index, albedo, and normalized difference water index.

abstract = {The performance of Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) thermal infrared (TIR) data product algorithms was evaluated for low spectral contrast surfaces (such as vegetation and water) in a test site close to Valencia, Spain. Concurrent ground measurements of surface temperature, emissivity, and atmospheric radiosonde profiles were collected at the test site, which is a thermally homogeneous area of rice crops with nearly full vegetation cover in summer. Using the ground data and the local radiosonde profiles, at-sensor radiances were simulated for the ASTER TIR channels and compared with L1B data (calibrated at-sensor radiances) showing discrepancies up to 3{\%} in radiance for channel 10 at 8.3 $\mu$m (equivalently, 2.5 °C in temperature or 7{\%} in emissivity), whereas channel 13 (10.7 $\mu$m) yielded a closer agreement (maximum difference of 0.5{\%} in radiance or 0.4 °C in temperature). We also tested the ASTER standard products of land surface temperature (LST) and spectral emissivity generated with the Temperature-Emissivity Separation (TES) algorithm with standard atmospheric correction from both global data assimilation system profiles and climatology profiles. These products showed anomalous emissivity spectra with lower emissivity values and larger spectral contrast (or maximum-minimum emissivity difference, MMD) than expected, and as a result, overestimated LSTs. In this work, a scene-based procedure is proposed to obtain more accurate MMD estimates for low spectral contrast materials (vegetation and water) and therefore a better retrieval of LST and emissivity with the TES algorithm. The method uses various gray-bodies or near gray-bodies with known emissivities and assumes that the calibration and atmospheric correction performed with local radiosonde data are accurate for channel 13. Taking the channel 13 temperature (atmospherically and emissivity corrected) as the true LST, the radiances for the other channels were simulated and used to derive linear relationships between ASTER digital numbers and at-ground radiances for each channel. The TES algorithm was applied to the adjusted radiances and the resulting products showed a closer agreement with the ground measurements (differences lower than 1{\%} in channel 13 emissivities and within ± 0.3 °C in temperature for rice and sea pixels). {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A simple analytical method for estimating surface soil moisture directly from rainfall data is proposed and studied. Soil moisture dynamics are represented by a linear stochastic partial differential equation [Entekhabi and Rodriguez-Iturbe, 1994]. A diagnostic equation is derived from the soil moisture dynamics equation by eliminating the diffusion term. The derived daily soil moisture function is a time-weighted average of previous cumulative rainfall over a given period (e.g., {\textgreater}14 days). The advantage of this method is that information on the initial condition of soil moisture, which is often not available at all times and locations, is not needed. The loss coefficient in the diagnostic equation for soil moisture can be estimated from land surface characteristics and soil properties. The method for determining the averaging window size, the loss coefficient, and the infiltration coefficient are described and demonstrated. The soil moisture data observed during three field experiments, i.e., Monsoon'90, Washita'92, and SGP'97, are compared to the calculated soil moisture. The results indicate that the proposed method is robust and has the potential for useful soil moisture predictions.},

abstract = {In this paper, three methods to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) from thermal infrared data supplied by band 6 of the Thematic Mapper (TM) sensor onboard the Landsat 5 satellite are compared. The first of them lies on the estimation of the land surface temperature from the radiative transfer equation using in situ radiosounding data. The others two are the mono-window algorithm developed by Qin et al. [International Journal of Remote Sensing 22 (2001) 3719] and the single-channel algorithm developed by Jim{\'{e}}nez- Mu{\~{n}}oz and Sobrino [Journal of Geophysical Research 108 (2003)]. The land surface emissivity (LSE) values needed in order to apply these methods have been estimated from a methodology that uses the visible and near infrared bands. Finally, we present a comparison between the LST measured in situ and the retrieved by the algorithms over an agricultural region of Spain (La Plana de Requena-Utiel). The results show a root mean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.009 for emissivity and lower than 1 K for land surface temperature when the Jim{\'{e}}nez-Mu{\~{n}}oz algorithm is used. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Aerosol backscatter measurements from a Vaisala CL31 ceilometer are compared directly with a co-located 532/1064 nm lidar in order to validate the CL31 for remote sensing of vertical aerosol structure. The cases examined include a significant aerosol event (biomass burning), which by virtue of its vertical extent, provides a robust measure of the vertical range of the ceilometer for aerosol applications. A second case is presented when the instruments were separated in order to illustrate the utility of a network of such instruments for elucidating spatial patterns in aerosol distribution and the advection of elevated pollutant layers. When co-located, the instruments show remarkable agreement and indicate that the CL31 can detect aerosol layers up to 3000 m AGL in ideal conditions (at night and with high aerosol concentrations as found in biomass burning or dust plumes). When separated, multiple instruments provide an opportunity to examine advection of pollutant layers as well as their evolution. This suggests that installation of a ceilometer network would provide a cost-effective means of examining three-dimensional aspects of regional air quality as well as distinguishing between regional and local sources of pollution},

abstract = {Warming associated with urban development will be exacerbated in future years by temperature increases due to climate change. The strategic implementation of urban green infrastructure (UGI) e.g. street trees, parks, green roofs and facades can help achieve temperature reductions in urban areas while delivering diverse additional benefits such as pollution reduction and biodiversity habitat. Although the greatest thermal benefits of UGI are achieved in climates with hot, dry summers, there is comparatively little information available for land managers to determine an appropriate strategy for UGI implementation under these climatic conditions. We present a framework for prioritisation and selection of UGI for cooling. The framework is supported by a review of the scientific literature examining the relationships between urban geometry, UGI and temperature mitigation which we used to develop guidelines for UGI implementation that maximises urban surface temperature cooling. We focus particularly on quantifying the cooling benefits of four types of UGI: green open spaces (primarily public parks), shade trees, green roofs, and vertical greening systems (green walls and facades) and demonstrate how the framework can be applied using a case study from Melbourne, Australia.},

abstract = {The measurements of surface temperature are prone to important directional anisotropy in relation to the structure of the urban canopy and the radiative and energy exchanges inside it. Following the work of Lagouarde et al. 2010 that describes the daytime conditions, this paper focuses on the experimental analysis and modelling of the nighttime directional anisotropy. An extensive data set of airborne thermal infrared (TIR) measurements was collected over the city of Toulouse, France in the framework of the CAPITOUL project (Masson et al., 2008). The TIR measurements use a pair of thermal cameras equipped with wide angle lenses installed aboard a small aircraft. Three flights were made between 21:45 and 23:15 UTC, one in autumn and 2 in winter during 2004 and 2005 intensive operation periods (IOPs). The experimental results show that (i) the nighttime TIR directional anisotropy remains lower than 1??C for zenithal view angles up to 50??, and (ii) the nighttime anisotropy is insensitive to the azimuthal viewing direction. A modelling approach that combines a simplified 3D representation of the urban canopy with 2 energy transfer models, TEB and SOLENE, is then proposed. It confirms the experimental results quite well. Possible uncertainties on the geometry of the canopy and on most important thermo-radiative surface parameters are shown to have only little impact on the modelled TIR directional anisotropy. The time evolution of TIR anisotropy throughout night is simulated: for the fall and winter conditions studied the effects of thermal inertia completely vanish about 3 to 4. h after sunset, and the anisotropy never exceeds 2??C up to 60?? zenithal view angles. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

In extreme droughts trees are increasingly susceptible to attack by pests and pathogens, which can lead to major changes in nutrient flux to the soil. Extreme droughts often lead to more common and more intense forest fires, causing dramatic changes in the nutrient storage and loss from forest ecosystems. Changes in the future manifestation of drought will affect carbon uptake and storage in forests, leading to feedbacks to the Earth's climate system. We must improve the recognition of drought in nature, our ability to manage our forests in the face of drought, and the parameterization of drought in earth system models for improved predictions of carbon uptake and storage in the world's forests.

abstract = {Abstract The calibration and accuracy of the Eppley precision infrared radiometer (PIR) is examined both theoretically and experimentally. A rederivation of the fundamental energy balance of the PIR indicates that the calibration equation in common use in the geophysical community today contains an erroneous factor of the emissivity of the thermopile. If a realistic value (0.98) for the emissivity is used, then this leads to errors in the total flux of 5–10 W m−2. The basic precision of the instrument is found to be about 1.5{\%} of the total IR irradiance when the thermopile voltage and both dome and case temperatures are measured. If the manufacturer's optional battery-compensated output is used exclusively, then the uncertainties increase to about 5{\%} of the total (20 W m−2). It is suggested that a modern radiative transfer model combined with radiosonde profiles can be used as a secondary standard to improve the absolute accuracy of PIR data from field programs.

abstract = {In the modern era of urban climatology, much emphasis has been placed on observing and documenting heat island magnitudes in cities around the world. Urban climate literature consequently boasts a remarkable accumulation of observational heat island studies. Through time, however, methodologists have raised concerns about the authenticity of these studies, especially regarding the measurement, definition and reporting of heat island magnitudes. This paper substantiates these concerns through a systematic review and scientific critique of heat island literature from the period 1950-2007. The review uses nine criteria of experimental design and communication to critically assess methodological quality in a sample of 190 heat island studies. Results of this assessment are discouraging: the mean quality score of the sample is just 50 percent, and nearly half of all urban heat island magnitudes reported in the sample are judged to be scientifically indefensible. Two areas of universal weakness in the literature sample are controlled measurement and openness of method: one-half of the sample studies fail to sufficiently control the confounding effects of weather, relief or time on reported 'urban' heat island magnitudes, and three-quarters fail to communicate basic metadata regarding instrumentation and field site characteristics. A large proportion of observational heat island literature is therefore compromised by poor scientific practice. This paper concludes with recommendations for improving method and communication in heat island studies through better scrutiny of findings and more rigorous reporting of primary research. Copyright.

abstract = {The effect of variations in land cover on mean radiant temperature (T mrt ) is explored through a simple scheme developed within the radiation model SOLWEIG. Outgoing longwave radiation is parameterised using surface temperature observations on a grass and an asphalt surface, whereas outgoing shortwave radiation is modelled through variations in albedo for the different surfaces. The influence of ground surface materials on T mrt is small compared to the effects of shadowing. Nevertheless, altering ground surface materials could contribute to a reduction in T mrt to reduce the radiant load during heat-wave episodes in locations where shadowing is not an option. Evaluation of the new scheme suggests that despite its simplicity it can simulate the outgoing fluxes well, especially during sunny conditions. However, it underestimates at night and in shadowed locations. One grass surface used to develop the parameterisation, with very different characteristics compared to an evaluation grass site, caused T mrt to be underestimated. The implications of using high temporal resolution (e.g. 15 minutes) meteorological forcing data under partly cloudy conditions are demonstrated even for fairly proximal sites.},

abstract = {This study reports on the radiation and energy balance of three sites (rural, suburban, and urban) located along an urbanization gradient in the Montreal, QC, region for two winters (DecemberMarch) with contrasting snow regimes. The urban and suburban sites had similar albedo which was about half that at the rural site during the snow-cover period. Temporal variability in albedo was attributable to the presence of snow on rooftops at the urban site and to a site-specific response to cloudiness at the suburban site. As compared to the suburban site, the urban site showed higher albedo inducing lower net radiation (Q) which was compensated for by greater anthropogenic heat flux (QF), so that the urban site had highest total available energy (Q QF). Hourly QF estimates were a significant term in the winter energy budget analysis. QF was dominated by building heating at both urbanized sites, while vehicular traffic contributed to rush hour peaks. Daytime total available energy was mostly dissipated as sensible heat flux (QH) at the beginning of the winter season and mostly stored ($\Delta$QS) towards the end of the winter at both urbanized sites. Daytime energy partitioning into QH and $\Delta$QS was correlated with air temperature with no significant differences between urbanized sites. On a daily time scale, available energy was mostly stored before noon and dissipated as QH in the afternoon at both urbanized sites. Urbanized sites showed differences in diurnal variability of QH and $\Delta$QS occurring in the afternoon and evening. Latent heat flux (QE) was low throughout winter and accounted for 10{\%} of the total available energy during daytime at the urbanized sites. Water vapour emissions showed intra-urban differences in their response to wintertime climatic conditions. Copyright 2010 Royal Meteorological Society},

The results reveal strong directional variations in the observed apparent surface temperature. The variations arise due to the differential patterns of irradiated and shaded surfaces within the sensor field of view created by the three-dimensional urban surface structure and the position of the Sun. The directional variations may be considered to be a form of effective anisotropy due to the large scale roughness of the urban surface. Variations in excess of 9 C were measured over a downtown area. Urban residential and light industrial land-use areas also exhibited strong effective anisotropy. The directional temperature variations are of similar magnitude to atmospheric corrections applied to thermal imagery. This implies that effective anisotropy should receive serious consideration in the interpretation of thermal imagery obtained over urban areas. The scale dependence of the effective anisotropy is discussed.},

abstract = {A generalized approach for estimating season-specific diurnal profiles of anthropogenic heating for cities is presented. Each profile consists of heat released from three components: building sector, transportation sector, and metabolism. In turn, the building sector is divided into heat released from electricity consumption and heat released from heating fuels such as natural gas and fuel oil. Each component is developed separately based on a population density formulation. The profiles are based on commonly available data resources that are mapped onto the diurnal cycle using seasonal profile functions. Representative winter and summer weekday profiles are developed and presented for six large US cities. The diurnal profiles have morning and evening peaks, with summertime maxima up to 60Wm
                        -2. Anthropogenic heating in winter is generally larger, with maxima up to 75Wm
                        -2. While these analyses were carried out at the city-scale the paper discusses how the same data sources could be applied at scales down to the individual census tract (or traffic analysis zone), resulting in high spatial resolution profiles and larger maxima corresponding to higher population densities in the urban core. Based on our analysis of San Francisco we find that the urban core region may have a daytime population density that is 5-10 times that of the city-scale value. Hence, the corresponding anthropogenic heating values in the urban core will be 5-10 times the magnitudes of the city-scale values presented in this paper. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Between the winters of 2013/14 and 2014/15 during the strong North American drought, the northeast Pacific experienced the largest marine heatwave ever recorded. Here we combine observations with an ensemble of climate model simulations to show that teleconnections between the North Pacific and the weak 2014/2015 El Nino linked the atmospheric forcing patterns of this event. These teleconnection dynamics from the extratropics to the tropics during winter 2013/14, and then back to the extratropics during winter 2014/15, are a key source of multi-year persistence of the North Pacific atmosphere. The corresponding ocean anomalies map onto known patterns of North Pacific decadal variability, specifically the North Pacific Gyre Oscillation (NPGO) in 2014 and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) in 2015. A large ensemble of climate model simulations predicts that the winter variance of the NPGO- and PDO-like patterns increases under greenhouse forcing, consistent with other studies suggesting an increase in the atmospheric extremes that lead to drought over North America.},

abstract = {‘Local climate zones' (LCZs) comprise a new and systematic classification of field sites for heat island studies. The classification divides urban and rural landscapes into 17 standard classes, each defined by structural and land cover properties that influence air temperature at screen height. This study is the first to evaluate the conceptual division of LCZs with temperature observations and simulation results from surface–atmosphere models. Results confirm that thermal contrasts exist among all LCZ classes, and that such contrasts are governed largely by building height and spacing, pervious surface fraction, tree density, and soil wetness. Therefore, partitioning of landscapes into structural and land cover classes, or ‘LCZs,' is deemed justified for the purposes of field site classification in heat island studies. Also justified is the use of inter-zone temperature difference (TLCZ X−Y) to quantify heat island magnitude. To further improve the LCZ system, we encourage other researchers to observe and model the climatic conditions of its varied classes. Especially useful would be tests using field data from different urban and rural environments to those in this study, and running more advanced urban canopy models with demonstrated predictive capability.},

This ‘new' measure (dr) is a reformulation of Willmott's index of agreement, which was developed in the 1980s. It (dr)is dimensionless, bounded by −1.0 and 1.0 and, in general, more rationally related to model accuracy than are other existing indices. It also is quite flexible, making it applicable to a wide range of model-performance problems. The two main published versions of Willmott's index as well as four other comparable dimensionless indices – proposed by Nash and Sutcliffe in 1970, Watterson in 1996, Legates and McCabe in 1999 and Mielke and Berry in 2001 – are compared with the new index. Of the six, Legates and McCabe's measure is most similar to dr. Repeated calculations of all six indices, from intensive random resamplings of predicted and observed spaces, are used to show the covariation and differences between the various indices, as well as their relative efficacies.

abstract = {Generating fine-scale time series of intermittent rainfall that are fully consistent with any given coarse-scale totals is a key and open issue in many hydrological problems. We propose a stationary disaggregation method that simulates rainfall time series with given dependence structure, wet/dry probability, and marginal distribution at a target finer (lower-level) time scale, preserving full consistency with variables at a parent coarser (higher-level) time scale. We account for the intermittent character of rainfall at fine time scales by merging a discrete stochastic representation of intermittency and a continuous one of rainfall depths. This approach yields a unique and parsimonious mathematical framework providing general analytical formulations of mean, variance, and autocorrelation function (ACF) for a mixed-type stochastic process in terms of mean, variance, and ACFs of both continuous and discrete components, respectively. To achieve the full consistency between variables at finer and coarser time scales in terms of marginal distribution and coarse-scale totals, the generated lower-level series are adjusted according to a procedure that does not affect the stochastic structure implied by the original model. To assess model performance, we study rainfall process as intermittent with both independent and dependent occurrences, where dependence is quantified by the probability that two consecutive time intervals are dry. In either case, we provide analytical formulations of main statistics of our mixed-type disaggregation model and show their clear accordance with Monte Carlo simulations. An application to rainfall time series from real world is shown as a proof of concept.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the relationship between applied policy research commissioned by the state and the development and maintenance of critical human geographies. In contrast with recent debates, which have centred on the relative status of human geography within policy circles, we focus on the often mundane and messy realities of undertaking policy research. The paper argues that applied policy research offers con- siderable potential for human geographers to pursue substantive and normative concerns, but can also place geographers in complex and demanding situations that present practical and ethical challenges. In such contexts, being ‘relevant' in the manner demanded by policy actors while maintaining critical integrity necessitates a high degree of reflexivity, strategic calculation and tradeoffs between principles and prag- matism. The paper draws on our experience of undertaking contract research on parish and town councils for the UK government. We emphasize the opportunities and pitfalls represented by the internal differ- entiation of the state, the importance of active negotiation and compromise with clients and stakeholders, the mediating role played by the ‘evidence base', the politics of expertise and the use of applied policy research as a platform for wider policy engagement. The paper concludes by calling for greater reflection on the realities of applied policy research.},

To ensure the long-term prosperity of its urban forest, a city should have an effective forest management plan that is guided by timely and accurate spatial information. High-spatial-resolution colour-infrared imagery is a commonly available source of forestry information, but accurate automated tree cover extraction in an urban environment remains a challenge. Presented is an effective, semiautomatic, object-based method for urban tree cover extraction, applied to 23645 ha of 30 cm colour-infrared imagery of London, Ontario, Canada. Detailed methods, including some new techniques, are presented for the empirical selection of segmentation and classification parameters, the selection of subclasses and training samples, rule-based error correction, and image object border smoothing. A majority-voting interpretation of sample points was performed to reduce the subjectivity of the accuracy assessment. A test of the overall classification accuracy using the proposed method on a 2 km × 2 km image tile showed an improvement of 12.8{\%} over that of a traditional maximum likelihood classification. The overall classification accuracy achieved for the entire city was 89.73{\%}, with user's and producer's accuracy for trees of 75.61{\%} and 86.36{\%}, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2010 CASI.},

abstract = {Thermal remote sensing of urban areas is affected by directional variations (anisotropy) of the upwelling thermal radiation. The anisotropy arises due to the three-dimensionally rough urban surface that creates microscale patterns of surface temperature variability associated with surface position, orientation and composition, coupled with a biased view of this rough surface by the remote sensor. The large magnitudes of observed urban thermal anisotropy suggest it can be a significant factor in the interpretation of urban surface characteristics such as the surface urban heat island and application of urban surface temperatures to modelling urban surface heat fluxes. Here we couple the SUM urban surface sensor view model (Soux et al. 2004) with the urban canopy energy balance model of Mills (1997) and a newly developed three-dimensional energy balance model to investigate the variability of thermal anisotropy with surface geometric parameters. Relatively large anisotropy is modelled for realistic urban H/W ratios, and realistic plan area ratios generate a 30{\%} variability of the thermal anisotropy over urban surfaces. Coupled simulations with both energy balance models yielded similar results for anisotropy in the case study examined. The simulations substantially under-estimated the anisotropy compared to observations from a helicopter-mounted thermal scanner despite showing good agreement between modelled and observed temperature differences between major urban surface facets. This suggests the simplified urban surface geometry used by the models is inadequate to replicate the observed anisotropy.},

Seven different urban ecosystems have been identified: street trees; lawns/parks; urban forests; cultivated land; wetlands; lakes/sea; and streams. These systems generate a range of ecosystem services. In this paper, six local and direct services relevant for Stockholm are addressed: air filtration, micro climate regulation, noise reduction, rainwater drainage, sewage treatment, and recreational and cultural values. It is concluded that the locally generated ecosystem services have a substantial impact on the quality-of-life in urban areas and should be addressed in land-use planning.},

abstract = {Future space-borne imaging spectrometers could enable global comparative analyses of urban composition. In particular, the high spectral resolution of imaging spectrometry could improve the discrimination of materials that have similar spectral signatures but are functionally dissimilar, such as turfgrass and trees. However, the amount of reflected energy needed to measure narrow-band reflectance with acceptable signal-to-noise ratios means that space-borne imaging spectrometry data will be collected at relatively coarse spatial resolutions, potentially limiting its usefulness for mapping urban composition. In this study, we use Airborne Visible Infra-Red Imaging Spectrometer-Classic and -Next Generation imaging spectrometry acquired in the summer of 2014 over the Santa Barbara, California area to quantify sub-pixel urban composition at fine (4 m) and coarse (18 m) spatial resolutions. We develop and compare spectral libraries of single- and multiple-resolution endmembers, and use Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis to estimate sub-pixel fractions of spectrally dissimilar materials (vegetation, impervious, pervious) as well as pairs of spectrally similar materials (turfgrass and tree, paved and roof, non-photosynthetic vegetation and soil) at both resolutions. Fractions were validated using 1 m orthophotography. Overall, fractional accuracy was affected by the spatial resolution of the spectral library and image, and the (dis)similarity of the measured classes. Spectral libraries of multiple-resolution endmembers performed better than single-resolution libraries, likely because they increase within-class variance by capturing multiple levels of material variability that occur across spatial scales. A positive relationship was observed between pixel size and the number of sub-pixel materials, however significant pixel mixing occurred at 4 m resolution, with an average of 48{\%} of all pixels modeled by more than one endmember. Fractional estimates produced by the best performing libraries at 4 m and 18 m resolution correlated with validation fractions, with mean R2 {\textgreater} 0.89 for spectrally dissimilar classes and mean R2 {\textgreater} 0.76 for spectrally similar classes. These results demonstrate the scalability of fractional estimates of urban materials using imaging spectrometry, suggesting its potential for future global urban analyses.},

abstract = {Sustainable development can be defined as that which meets the needs of the current generation while leaving sufficient resources for the needs of future generations. A central objective is to decouple conventional resource use (and its corollary, waste generation) from economic development through technological innovation, improved efficiency and changes in individual practices. As the global population becomes urbanized and human activity is concentrated in urban areas, settlement planning is a key aspect of sustainability. The widespread inclusion of environmental objectives in urban plans at all scales provides an opportunity for the incorporation of urban climate knowledge into the planning process on a routine basis. Many of the stated objectives have both direct and indirect connections to climate. However, for this to happen, climate research and results must be linked more explicitly to the objectives of the sustainable settlement. In this paper, the relevance of sustainability to urban design and climate is discussed and the potential contribution of current urban climatology is assessed, identifying areas of special consideration for transfer to achieve sustainable urban planning and design.},

abstract = {The urban thermal environment varies not only from its rural surroundings but also within the urban area due to intra-urban differences in land-use and surface characteristics. Understanding the causes of this intra-urban variability is a first step in improving urban planning and development. Toward this end, a method for quantifying causes of spatial variability in the urban heat island has been developed. This paper presents the method as applied to a specific test case of Portland, Oregon. Vehicle temperature traverses were used to determine spatial differences in summertime {\~{}}2 m air temperature across the metropolitan area in the afternoon. A tree-structured regression model was used to quantify the land-use and surface characteristics that have the greatest influence on daytime UHI intensity. The most important urban characteristic separating warmer from cooler regions of the Portland metropolitan area was canopy cover. Roadway area density was also an important determinant of local UHI magnitudes. Specifically, the air above major arterial roads was found to be warmer on weekdays than weekends, possibly due to increased anthropogenic activity from the vehicle sector on weekdays. In general, warmer regions of the city were associated with industrial and commercial land-use. The downtown core, whilst warmer than the rural surroundings, was not the warmest part of the Portland metropolitan area. This is thought to be due in large part to local shading effects in the urban canyons.},

abstract = {In this study, the urban heat island of Toronto was characterized and estimated in order to examine the impact of the selection of rural sites on the estimation of urban heat island (UHI) intensity ( Delta T sub(u-r)). Three rural stations, King Smoke Tree (KST), Albion Hill, and Millgrove, were used for the analysis of UHI intensity for two urban stations, Toronto downtown (Toronto) and Toronto Pearson (Pearson) using data from 1970 to 2000. The UHI intensity was characterized as winter dominating and summer dominating, depending on the choice of the rural station. The analyses of annual and seasonal trends of Delta T sub(u-r) suggested that urban heat island clearly appears in winter at both Toronto and Pearson. However, due to the mitigating effect on temperature from Lake Ontario, the estimated trend of UHI intensity was found to be less at Toronto compared to that at Pearson which has no direct lake effect. In terms of the impacts of the rural stations, for both KST and Millgrove, the trends in UHI intensity were found to be statistically significant and also were in good agreement with the estimates of UHI intensities reported for other large cities in the USA. Depending on the choice of the rural station, the estimated trend for the UHI intensity at Toronto ranges from 0.01 degree C/decade to 0.02 degree C/decade, and that at Pearson ranges from 0.03 degree C/decade to 0.035 degree C/decade during 1970-2000. From the analysis of the seasonal distribution of Delta T sub(u-r), the UHI intensity was found to be higher at Toronto in winter than that at Pearson for all three rural stations. This was likely accounted for by the lower amount of anthropogenic heat flux at Pearson. Considering the results from the statistical analysis with respect to the geographic and surface features for each rural station, KST was suggested to be a better choice to estimate UHI intensity at Toronto compared to the other rural stations. The analysis from the current study suggests that the selection of a unique urban-rural pair to estimate UHI intensity for a city like Toronto is a critical task, as it will be for any city, and it is imperative to consider some key features such as the physiography, surface characteristics of the urban and rural stations, the climatology such as the trends in annual and seasonal variation of UHI with respect to the physical characteristics of the stations, and also more importantly the objectives of a particular study in the context of UHI effect.},

abstract = {In a recent article, Thrift has presented an optimistic account of the future of Geography. While this reply is broadly supportive of his claims that Geography is more diverse, and has more to offer than ever before, it is less optimistic with respect to the prospects for the survival of Geography as a unitary academic discipline. Experiences over the last 20 years in the UK higher education, in particular, the 2001 RAE exercise, point to an unfavourable institutional climate for the discipline. Within Geography, the ever-increasing diversity of its subject matter and research philosophy poses problems for disciplinary identity. This is reflected in the more restricted perspective of the subject outside the universities, and is compounded by a weakening of the link between Geography in the universities and the schools. In these circumstances, serious attention must be given to the changing nature of the discipline, to its positioning with respect to other subjects, and to its relations with the wider world. At a time of academic, cultural, technological and social dynamism, there are, nevertheless, opportunities as well as dangers for the subject. Although this reply is an explicitly bleak one regarding the future, the implicit message is that Geography can (and should) still prosper. The more positive outcome, however, rests on an appreciation and nurturing of a more traditional geographical heritage than Thrift identifies, as well as a more creative view of the relationship between fundamental and applied research. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A distinct annual course of the UHI intensity is observed; the greatest differences occur during summer nights when skies are clear. In winter, favorable conditions for the existence of the UHI occur less frequently, and the intensity of the UHI is smaller. In the daytime the city is very often colder than its surroundings. Two types of spatial structure of the heat island have been observed: multi-cellular type, occurring on windless conditions (0–1m/s), and a more simple general type with the 2–4m/s wind. The distribution of temperature on the night of February 2/3 and 5/6 1996 is presented; the UHI reached an extremely high intensity then (up to 12°C).},

Along with the concept of ‘planetary boundaries', the idea that humanity has entered a new geological epoch of its own making is currently attracting considerable attention – both within and beyond the world of Earth surface science from whence both notions originate. This paper summarises the origins and evolution of the scientific discourse since the Anthropocene idea was first proposed in 2000. It ends by outlining the potential relevance of the Anthropocene and planetary boundaries ideas to Geography – potential because both concepts have only recently received serious attention in the discipline. The next paper, following on from this, then reviews these early geographical interpretations of the two scientific buzzwords. The subsequent paper looks ahead to future options should these terms really begin to catch-on outside Geography. If they become societal keywords, then geographers should be participants in, rather than mere observers of, the unfolding discussion. As we will discover, some geographers are well-placed to shape future discourse and practice, but there is considerable potential for many others to join the fray.},

abstract = {A review of the physical characteristics of sulfur-containing aerosols, with respect to size distribution of the physical distributions, sulfur distributions, distribution modal characteristics, nuclei formation rates, aerosol growth characteristics, and in situ measurement, has been made. Physical size distributions can be characterized well by a trimodal model consisting of three additive lognormal distributions. When atmospheric physical aerosol size distributions are characterized by the trimodal model, the following typical modal parameters are observed:. 1. Nuclei mode - geometric mean size by volume, DGVn, from 0.015 to 0.04 ??m. ??gn=1.6, nucler mode volumes from 0.0005 over the remote oceans to 9 ??m3 cm-3 on an urban freeway. 2. Accumulation mode - geometric mean size by volume, DGVa, from 0.15 to 0.5 ??m, ??ga=1.6-2.2 and mode volume concentrations from 1 for very clean marine or continental backgrounds to as high as 300 ??m3 cm-3 under very polluted conditions in urban areas. 3. Coarse particle mode - geometric mean size by volume, DGVc, from 5 to 30 ??m, ??gn=2-3, and mode volume concentrations from 2 to 1000 ??m3 cm-3. It has also been concluded that the fine particles (Dp{\textless}2 ??m) are essentially independent in formation, transformation and removal from the coarse particles (Dp{\textgreater}2 ??m). Modal characterization of impactor-measured sulfate size distributions from the literature shows that the sulfate is nearly all in the accumulation mode and has the same size distribution as the physical accumulation mode distribution. Average sulfate aerodynamic geometric mean dia. was found to be 0.48??0.1 ??m (0.37??0.1 ??m vol. dia.) and ??g=2.00??0.29. Concentrations range from a low of about 0.04 ??g m-3 over the remote oceans to over 8 ??g m-3 under polluted conditions over the continents. Review of the data on nucleation in smog chambers and in the atmosphere suggests that when SO2, is present, SO2-to-aerosol conversion dominates the Aitken nuclei count and, indirectly, through coagulation and condensation, the accumulation mode size and concentration. There are indications that nucleation is ubiquitous in the atmosphere, ranging from values as low as 2 cm-3 h-1 over the clean remote oceans to a high of 6??106 cm-3 h-1 in a power plant plume under sunny conditions. There is considerable theoretical and experimental evidence that even if most of the mass for the condensational growth of the accumulation mode comes from hydrocarbon conversion, sulfur conversion provides most of the nuclei. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In this paper, we argue for an approach that goes beyond an institutional reading of urban climate governance to engage with the ways in which government is accomplished through social and technical practices. Central to the exercise of government in this manner, we argue, are ‘climate change experiments'– purposive interventions in urban socio-technical systems designed to respond to the imperatives of mitigating and adapting to climate change in the city. Drawing on three different concepts – of governance experiments, socio-technical experiments, and strategic experiments – we first develop a framework for understanding the nature and dynamics of urban climate change experiments. We use this conceptual analysis to frame a scoping study of the global dimensions of urban climate change experimentation in a database of 627 urban climate change experiments in 100 global cities. The analysis charts when and where these experiments occur, the relationship between the social and technical aspects of experimentation and the governance of urban climate change experimentation, including the actors involved in their governing and the extent to which new political spaces for experimentation are emerging in the contemporary city. We find that experiments serve to create new forms of political space within the city, as public and private authority blur, and are primarily enacted through forms of technical intervention in infrastructure networks, drawing attention to the importance of such sites in urban climate politics. These findings point to an emerging research agenda on urban climate change experiments that needs to engage with the diversity of experimentation in different urban contexts, how they are conducted in practice and their impacts and implications for urban governance and urban life.},

abstract = {A new technique, called multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA), was developed and tested in the Santa Monica Mountains, using Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data acquired in the fall of 1994 to map California chaparral. The technique models remotely measured spectra as linear combinations of pure spectra, called endmembers, while allowing the types and number of endmembers to vary on a per pixel basis. In this manner, vegetation is characterized by a unique set of endmembers as well as by the fractions. Reference endmembers were selected from a library of field and laboratory measured spectra of leaves, canopies, nonphotosynthetic materials (e.g., stems), and soils and used to develop a series of candidate models. Each candidate model was applied to the image, then, on a per pixel basis, assessed in terms of fractions, root mean squared (RMS) error, and residuals. If a model met all criteria, it was listed as a candidate for that pixel. For this study, selection criteria included fractions between -0.01 and 1.01, an RMS less than 0.025 and a residual less than 0.025 in seven or more contiguous bands. A total of 889 two-endmember models were evaluated and used to generate 276 three-endmember models. To facilitate model selection from a large pool of candidates, an optimal set was selected to provide maximal areal coverage. A total of 24 two-endmember and 12 three-endmember models were chosen. These models were used to generate fraction images and vegetation maps showing evergreen and drought deciduous or senesced vegetation. We found that a majority of the image could be modeled as two-endmember models. Three-endmember models provided greater areal coverage, yet provided poorer vegetation discrimination due to an increase in model overlap (two or more model candidates modeling the same pixel). The vegetation maps demonstrate that the technique is capable of discriminating a large number of spectrally distinct types of vegetation while capturing the mosaic-like spatial distribution typical of chaparral. However, additional research is required to fully evaluate the technique and validate the vegetation maps that were produced.},

abstract = {The downscaling of geostationary diurnal thermal data can ease the lack of land surface temperature (LST) datasets that combine high spatial and temporal resolution. However, the downscaling of diurnal LST data is more demanding than single scenes. This is because the spatiotemporal interrelationships of the original LST data have to be preserved and accurately reproduced by the downscaled LST (DLST) data. To that end, LST disaggregation kernels/predictors that provide information about the spatial distribution of LST during different times of a day can prove especially useful. Such LST predictors are the LST Annual Cycle Parameters (ACPs). In this work, multitemporal ACPs are employed for downscaling daytime and nighttime {\~{}}4 km geostationary LST from SEVIRI (Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager) down to 1 km. The overall goal is to assess if the use of the ACPs can improve the estimation of the diurnal range of DLST (daytime DLST minus nighttime DLST). The evaluation is performed by comparing the DLST diurnal range maps with reference data from MODIS (Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer) and also with data retrieved from a modified version of the TsHARP (Thermal Sharpening) algorithm. The results suggest that the ACPs increase the downscaling performance, improve the estimation of diurnal DLST range and produce more accurate spatial patterns.},

abstract = {This study used tree data from field plots in urban areas to describe forest structure in urban areas throughout California. The plot data were used with numerical models to calculate several ecosystem services produced by trees. A series of transfer functions were calculated to scale-up results from the plots to the landscape using urban tree canopy (UTC) mapped at 1-m resolution for each combination of 6 land use classes and climate zones. California's UTC covered 15{\%} of the urban area and contained 173.2 million trees, five per city resident. UTC per capita was lowest among U.S. states (90.8 m2), indicating ample opportunity for tree planting. Oaks were the most abundant taxon (22{\%}) and overall plantings were youthful. The annual value of ecosystem services was estimated at {\$}8.3 billion and the urban forests asset value was {\$}181 billion. Assuming an average annual per tree management cost of {\$}19 and benefit of {\$}47.83, {\$}2.52 in benefit was returned for every dollar spent. The threat posed by Invasive Shot Hole Borer (Euwallacea sp.) illustrates that urban forests are a relatively fragile resource whose contributions to human health and well-being can be suddenly jeopardized. One scenario projected that should Southern California cities lose 50{\%} (11.6 million) of all susceptible trees, the value of ecoservices foregone over 10 years was {\$}616.6 million. The approximate cost of removing and replacing the trees was {\$}15.9 billion. Strategies to reduce the risk of catastrophic loss by increasing the resilience of California's urban forests are discussed.},

To test the effective albedo of the canyon an analytic solution of the multiple reflection problem is applied. The infinitesimally long canyon is di-vided into slices and a matrix of view factors for the slices is defined. Incoming shortwave radiation includes direct and diffuse parts and shadowing effects are included in the analysis. The model is validated against Aida's (1982) scale model data and measurements in a real canyon. The results demonstrate a rapid decrease of the effective albedo as the canyon aspect ratio (its height to width, H=W) are in-creased. It is also shown that diurnal changes of the effective albedo can be very complex depending on the particular combination of H=W ratio, surface reflectivity and canyon orientation.},

However, the role of urban lifestyle as a driving force of biodiversity change is not very well understood. This is partly because there is a gap between a social science approach focusing on lifestyle and a natural science approach focusing on biodiversity. We propose that the concept of ecological services and disservices is useful in connecting these approaches. Ecosystem services produced by urban green areas are the focus of a wide range of environmental studies, but disservices – such as safety issues in dark parks or pollen causing health problems – have gained only sporadic attention in environmental studies focused on urban ecosystems. We review and discuss different urban ecosystem disservices from a Northern European perspective. We conclude by addressing the key limitations and possibilities of the use of the concept of ecological disservices in urban biodiversity studies.},

abstract = {Cities create their own microclimates and their sites are almost always warmer, compared to a nearby rural location, than if the city were not there. The effect on temperatures measured in the city has been termed the 'urban heat island' (UHI). In this study we assess the strength of the UHI within and around London based on monthly and seasonal maximum, mean and minimum temperatures. The purpose of the study is not to look at UHI extremes on individually conducive days, but to show that the effect has a certain magnitude on monthly and seasonal averages, and assess whether this magnitude of UHI for Central London has increased over the twentieth century compared to rural locations around London (Jones et al., 2008). London is possibly the longest-studied UHI of any city; Luke Howard (1833) was probably the first scientist to suggest that the temperature recorded in a city was likely to be higher than that in the surrounding countryside. The major studies of urban-related warming in London since then have all recognized the importance of homo-geneous temperature series and the need to look at long time series, as opposed to the effects on individual days or short peri-ods. Moffitt (1972) compared the long Kew (KEW) record with that from Rothamsted (ROTH), remarking that this rural site is unlikely to be affected by any development at Harpenden (a mile to the northeast of the site). A study was conducted (in 1925) con-cerning a site move that took place in 1915. Although the study is no longer available, a letter in the station metadata files states that there was good agreement between readings at the two sites and that there was no regular pattern in the minor variations (Moffitt, 1972). Some additional discussion of this site move is given by Tyrrell (1972) and Moffitt (1973). ROTH is used as one of the three key sites in England for the Central England Temperature (CET) series, and no adjustments to its data have been made (Parker et al., 1992). Moffitt (1972) concluded that KEW warmed relative to ROTH between 1878 and 1968 by about 0.8 degC, slightly more in winter and summer and slightly less in spring and autumn. Moffitt (1972) also showed that KEW (for annual aver-age temperature) was warmer than ROTH in the 1880s by 0.74 degC, which agreed well with the height difference (123 metres) between the stations, assuming a standard lapse rate of 0.6 degC per 100 metres. This value will be important later when we assess the magnitude of Central London's UHI. We will also assess whether this value should be applied equally to maximum and minimum temperatures. Later work by Lee (1992) and Wilby (2003) used the more central London site of St James's Park (SJP) and replaced the ROTH rural record with Wisley (WIS). The periods of record were reduced to 1962–1989 and 1958–1998, respectively, and the empha-sis changed to the magnitude of UHI. Lee (1992) considered whether the urban-related warming trend had increased over his period of analysis, but was only able to find that minimum temperatures had risen while maxima decreased at SJP compared to WIS with no overall change in mean tem-peratures. Wilby (2003) found similar results to Lee (1992) and correlated counts of daily extreme UHI values (SJP warmer than WIS by more than 4 degC) against a number of synoptic indices. In this study we will use an additional site in Central London (London Weather Centre, LWC) and one in a more suburban location (Heathrow Airport, LHR), and use the full length of digitally available daily and monthly average records.},

The 2014 California drought is an archetype of an event characterized by not only low precipitation but also extreme high temperatures. From the raging wildfires, to record low storage levels and snowpack conditions, the impacts of this event can be felt throughout California. Wintertime water shortages worry decision-makers the most because it is the season to build up water supplies for the rest of the year. Here we show that the traditional univariate risk assessment methods based on precipitation condition may substantially underestimate the risk of extreme events such as the 2014 California drought because of ignoring the effects of temperature. We argue that a multivariate viewpoint is necessary for assessing risk of extreme events, especially in a warming climate. This study discusses a methodology for assessing the risk of concurrent extremes such as droughts and extreme temperatures.},

abstract = {Scale modelling is used to determine the relative contribution of heat transfer processes to the nocturnal cooling of urban parks and the characteristic temporal and spatial variation of surface temperature. Validation is achieved using a hardware model-to-numerical model-to-field observation chain of comparisons. For the calm case, modelling shows that urban-park differences of sky view factor and thermal admittance are the relevant properties governing the park cool island (PCI) effect. Reduction in sky view factor by buildings and trees decreases the drain of longwave radiation from the surface to the sky. Thus park areas near the perimeter where there may be a line of buildings or trees, or even sites within a park containing tree clumps or individual trees, generally cool less than open areas. The edge effect applies within distances of about 2.2 to 3.5 times the height of the border obstruction, i.e., to have any part of the park cooling at the maximum rate a square park must be at least twice these dimensions in width. Although the central areas of parks larger than this will experience greater cooling they will accumulate a larger volume of cold air that may make it possible for them to initiate a thermal circulation and extend the influence of the park into the surrounding city. Given real world values of sky view factor and thermal admittance it seems likely that radiation and conduction play almost equal roles in nocturnal PCI development. Evaporation is not a significant cooling mechanism in the nocturnal calm case but by day it is probably critical in establishing a PCI by sunset. It is likely that conditions that favour PCI by day (tree shade, soil wetness) retard PCI growth at night. The present work, which only deals with PCI growth, cannot predict which type of park will be coolest at night. Complete specification of nocturnal PCI magnitude requires knowledge of the PCI at sunset, and this depends on daytime energetics.},

abstract = {Abstract Estimating the likelihood of future climate change has become a priority objective within the research community. This is the case because of the advancement of science, because of user demand and because of the central role played by climate prediction in guiding adaptation policy. But are probabilities what climate policy really needs? This article reviews three key questions: (1) Why might we (not) need probabilities of climate change? (2) What are the problems in estimating probabilities? (3) How are researchers estimating probabilities? These questions are analysed within the context of adaptation to climate change. Overall, we conclude that the jury is still out on whether probabilities are useful for climate adaptation policy. The answer is highly context dependent and thus is a function of the goals and motivation of the policy analysis, the unit of analysis, timescale and the training of the analyst. Probability assessment in the context of climate change is always subjective, conditional and provisional. There are various problems in estimating the probability of future climate change, but reflexive human behaviour (i.e. actions explicitly influenced by information) is largely intractable in the context of prediction. Nonetheless, there is considerable scope to develop novel methodologies that combine conditional probabilities with scenarios and which are relevant for climate decision-making.},

abstract = {Urban heat islands (UHIs) describe the phenomenon of altered temperatures that occur in urban areas when compared to their rural surroundings. UHIs influence human well-being, human health and the city as an ecological niche. UHIs can be quantified with meteorological ground measurements of air temperatures or with remotely sensed land surface temperatures (surface urban heat island). Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages and are rarely combined. Further, within these approaches, different indicators for quantifying the UHIs are used. In this methodological study, we (1) combined data on land surface and air temperatures, (2) enriched the debate by suggesting the application of indicators for the two distinct data sets and (3) systematically quantified indicators of all approaches for the city of Leipzig, Germany. A relationship between the land surface and air temperatures was established. However, the results for the single indicators showed that the absolute values of the detected UHI in Leipzig depend on the selected indicator and the data set used. The main conclusion for future studies on UHIs is to use several UHI indicators in parallel to acknowledge the uncertainty of measuring the UHI using a single indicator and either ground measurements or remote sensing. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Life on Earth depends on photosynthesis. Photosynthetic systems evolved early in Earth history and have been stable for 2.5 billion years, providing prima facie evidence for the significance of pigments in plant functions. Photosynthetic pigments fill multiple roles from increasing the range of energy captured for photosynthesis to protective functions. Given the importance of pigments to leaf functioning, greater effort is needed to determine whether individual pigments can be identified and quantified in vivo using high fidelity spectroscopy. We review recent advances in detecting plant pigments at the leaf level and discuss successes and reasons why challenges remain for robust remote observation and quantification. New methods to identify and quantify individual pigments in the presence of overlapping absorption features would provide a major advance in understanding their biological functions, quantifying net carbon exchange, and identifying plant stresses. {\textcopyright} 2009.},

After preprocessing to pansharpen IKONOS image data, the method includes the following steps: (1) image segmentation; (2) supervised object-based classification into broad spectral classes including impervious surfaces; (3) spectral, spatial, textural and contextual parameters are developed from statistical comparison of the sample rooftop and other impervious surface objects and (4) these parameters are implemented in a fuzzy logic rule base to separate rooftops from other impervious surfaces. Classification of a test scene results in 93{\%} accuracy of rooftop identification, demonstrating the applicability of the method to the discrimination of spectrally similar but semantically variable classes.},

abstract = {Thermal infrared (TIR) cameras perfectly bridge the gap between (i) on-site measurements of land surface temperature (LST) providing high temporal resolution at the cost of low spatial coverage and (ii) remotely sensed data from satellites that provide high spatial coverage at relatively low spatio-temporal resolution. While LST data from satellite (LSTsat) and airborne platforms are routinely corrected for atmospheric effects, such corrections are barely applied for LST from ground-based TIR imagery (using TIR cameras; LSTcam). We show the consequences of neglecting atmospheric effects on LSTcam of different vegetated surfaces at landscape scale. We compare LST measured from different platforms, focusing on the comparison of LST data from on-site radiometry (LSTosr) and LSTcam using a commercially available TIR camera in the region of Bozen/Bolzano (Italy). Given a digital elevation model and measured vertical air temperature profiles, we developed a multiple linear regression model to correct LSTcam data for atmospheric influences. We could show the distinct effect of atmospheric conditions and related radiative processes along the measurement path on LSTcam, proving the necessity to correct LSTcam data on landscape scale, despite their relatively low measurement distances compared to remotely sensed data. Corrected LSTcam data revealed the dampening effect of the atmosphere, especially at high temperature differences between the atmosphere and the vegetated surface. Not correcting for these effects leads to erroneous LST estimates, in particular to an underestimation of the heterogeneity in LST, both in time and space. In the most pronounced case, we found a temperature range extension of almost 10 K.},

The results are very promising with root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of 1.5-1.8 K for six stations in Hamburg and explained variances of 97{\%}-98{\%}. Both the annual and diurnal cycles were well represented by the empirical models and the use of multitemporal data substantially increased the model performance. Further, the model was run in a forecast mode without actual LST information. Here, the best predictors reached RMSEs of 1.9-2.4 K and R2 of 95{\%}-97{\%} for a 2-h forecast.},

@book{Godfrey-Smith2003,
abstract = {How does science work? Does it tell us what the world is "really" like? What makes it different from other ways of understanding the universe? In Theory and Reality, Peter Godfrey-Smith addresses these questions by taking the reader on a grand tour of one hundred years of debate about science. The result is a completely accessible introduction to the main themes of the philosophy of science. Intended for undergraduates and general readers with no prior background in philosophy, Theory and Reality covers logical positivism; the problems of induction and confirmation; Karl Popper's theory of science; Thomas Kuhn and "scientific revolutions"; the views of Imre Lakatos, Larry Laudan, and Paul Feyerabend; and challenges to the field from sociology of science, feminism, and science studies. The book then looks in more detail at some specific problems and theories, including scientific realism, the theory-ladeness of observation, scientific explanation, and Bayesianism. Finally, Godfrey-Smith defends a form of philosophical naturalism as the best way to solve the main problems in the field. Throughout the text he points out connections between philosophical debates and wider discussions about science in recent decades, such as the infamous "science wars." Examples and asides engage the beginning student; a glossary of terms explains key concepts; and suggestions for further reading are included at the end of each chapter. However, this is a textbook that doesn't feel like a textbook because it captures the historical drama of changes in how science has been conceived over the last one hundred years. Like no other text in this field, Theory and Reality combines a survey of recent history of the philosophy of science with current key debates in language that any beginning scholar or critical reader can follow.},

abstract = {Vegetation and trees in particular play a key role in mitigating thermal load in urban areas. The goals of this study were to analyse species-specific microclimatic effects and to identify the role of leaf-area-density, transpiration, and stomatal conductance for cooling effects at urban sites. Air temperature, relative humidity and surface temperature were used to study the effects of six tree species with similar age structure in a residential area with comparable site conditions. Transpiration, stomatal conductance and leaf-area density were measured during the summer months in 2013. Air temperatures and relative humidity were monitored for four trees per street in hourly intervals, and surface temperatures were recorded in the afternoon for three hot days on the shaded and unshaded asphalt surfaces beneath the trees.Species differ significantly in their ability to reduce air and surface temperatures, as well as to increase relative humidity. Trees showing both a high leaf-area density and a high rate of transpiration are more effective in cooling the air temperatures. Differences in the surface temperatures of the tree shaded areas are more pronounced compared to the air temperatures. Thus, the surface temperatures of the full sun exposed areas are up to 15.2. K warmer than that in the tree shaded areas. The results provide information to decrease thermal load in urban areas for future tree planting by choosing species with high cooling potential. The highest cooling potential was measured for Corylus colurna and Tilia cordata '. Greenspire' and the lowest for Ulmus × hollandica 'Lobel'.},

abstract = {The UK policy change from 'flood defence' to 'flood risk management' in the 1990s has involved shifts to more distributed flood risk management responsibilities. This poses questions about roles of floodplain residents in community-led adaptation planning for changing flood risk, and how these roles can be supported/strengthened. Research evidence emphasises importance of informal/local/lay knowledge, 'watery sense of place', flood memories and shared flood heritage, in how communities prepare for, and recover from, floods. This paper outlines initial research outcomes from an interdisciplinary UK Economic and Social Research Council-funded research project that proposes the concept of 'sustainable flood memory' in the context of effective flood risk management. This is conceived as an approach to memory work that is community focused, archival, integrating individual and collective experiences, involving inter- and intra-generational communication, and strategies for its future. The project aims to increase understanding of how flood memories provide a platform for developing informal knowledge, so creating social learning opportunities in communities that can increase their adaptive capacities and flood resilience. It explores: how communities remember and archive flood experiences; how local flood knowledge is materialised, assimilated and protected; the role of catastrophic floods (e.g. July 2007, River Severn, UK) in building 'community' memory and flood risk knowledge; and whether informal knowledge is tacit or otherwise, if and how it is learned, and whether it can be transmitted, developed, revitalised and returned in settings where it is lost or lacking. {\textcopyright} 2012 WIT Press.},

Our results show that in Europe, the UHI intensity in summer has a strong correlation with the cluster size, which can be well fitted by an empirical sigmoid model. Furthermore, we find a novel seasonality of the UHI intensity for individual clusters in the form of hysteresis-like curves.We characterize the shape and identify apparent regional patterns},

abstract = {Major reviews of urban effects on local climate, extending from Kratzer in 1937 through to Landsberg in 1981, have dealt primarily with radiation, temperature, wind, and air quality. To a much lesser extent they have examined moisture-related elements including humidity, cloud, precipitation, and storminess. Selecting air temperature to represent the former group and precipitation amount to represent the latter, the author asserts that, because of the intrinsic physical differences between them, there are necessarily important differences in the methods to be used for their proper observation, analysis, presentation, and interpretation pertaining to urban effects. The principal differences are based in the fact that temperature is continuous in both time and space, whereas precipitation is continuous in neither. The author maintains that because of these differences, urban climatologists have had much greater success in specifying and explaining urban effects on temperature than on precipitation amount. Further, he makes the case that, lack of recognition that methods used for the study of urban effects on temperature are too often inappropriate for study of urban effects on precipitation amount, has led to a state of affairs where there remains basic uncertainty about the specification of urban effects on precipitation amount, and even greater uncertainty about their explanation. In making that case, the author includes 1) an historical perspective, 2) a critical evaluation of methods, 3) an overview of the status of urban precipitation climatology, and 4) recommendations concerning future research.

abstract = {The CAPITOUL experiment is a joint experimental effort in urban climate, including the energetic exchanges between the surface and the atmosphere, the dynamics of the boundary layer over the city and its interactions with aerosol chemistry. The campaign took place in the city of Toulouse in southwest France, for one year, from February 2004 to February 2005. This allowed the study of both the day-to-day and seasonal variability of urban climate processes. The observational network included surface stations (meteorology, energy balance, chemistry), profilers and, during intensive observing periods, aircraft and balloons. The urban Surface Energy Balance differs between summer and winter: in summer, the solar heat stored during the previous daytime period is enough to maintain the heat release at night, but in winter, almost all the energy comes from the anthropogenic heat released by space heating. Both processes produce the well known Urban Heat Island (UHI). The city is shown to impact the entire boundary layer on specific days, when an urban breeze is observed. In wintertime, fog is found to be modified due to the vertical structure of the nocturnal boundary layer above the city (which is slightly unstable and not stable). The measurements of aerosol properties in and downwind the city permitted documentation of the urban aerosol as well as the chemical transformation of these aerosols, in particular the ageing of carbonaceous aerosols during transport. The Toulouse aerosol is mainly composed of carbonaceous particles. There is important seasonal variation in the ratio of black carbon to organic carbon, in the concentration of sulfates and nitrates and in the related radiative aerosol impacts. SF(6) was released as a tracer in a suburban area of Toulouse during anticyclonic conditions with weak winds. The tracer measurements show dispersion was mainly driven by the surface sensible heat flux, and was highly sensitive to the urban heat island and also to the transport of boundary layer clouds. Modeling was fully integrated into the campaign. Surface energy balance and urban boundary layer processes have already been used to complement the analyses of the physical processes observed during the campaign. Companion papers detail most of these observation or modeling studies.},

abstract = {New developments of the international community in modeling the urban canopy surface energy balance are presented and classified into five main categories: (i) models statistically fit to observations, (ii) and (iii) modified vegetation schemes with or without drag terms in the canopy, and (iv) and (v), new urban canopy schemes, that present both horizontal and vertical surfaces, again with or without a drag approach. The advantages and disadvantages of each type of model are explained. In general, the more the physics are correctly simulated, the more complex are the urban phenomenon that can be addressed, on the other hand however, the more consuming of computer-time and difficult to couple with atmospheric models the scheme becomes. Present use of these new models in meso-scale atmospheric models show their ability to reproduce the phenomenon of the urban heat island (UHI) and some of its consequences urban breezes, storm initiation, interaction with sea-breeze. Their use opens up new perspectives, for example in the mitigation of the UHI, or assessment of the role of air-conditioning systems or the impact of urban dynamics on air pollution. However, there is need to validate further the different urban models available. In particular it is necessary to compare model output with urban surface energy balance measurements. An intercomparison exercise involving these urban schemes is suggested as an efficient way to assess and improve these models.},

abstract = {A data set spanning a period of 10 years and obtained from a combination of satellite remote sensing and model predictions is used to construct a global climatology of ocean wind and wave conditions. Results are presented for: significant wave height, peak and mean wave period and wave direction as well as wind speed and direction. The results are presented in terms of mean monthly statistics. The processed data set provides global resolution of 2°. The climatology clearly shows the zonal variation in both wind speed and wave height, with extreme conditions occurring at high latitudes. The important role played by the intense wave generation systems of the Southern Ocean is clear. Swell generated from storms in the Southern Ocean penetrates throughout the Indian, South Pacific and South Atlantic Oceans. During the Southern Hemisphere winter, this swell even penetrates into the North Pacific. The results confirm visual observations that the Southern Ocean is consistently the roughest ocean on earth. It is shown, however, that this is mainly caused by consistent high wind speeds, rather than the extended westerly fetch which exists. The west coasts of most continents have noticeably rougher wave climates than their respective east coasts, as a result of the longer generation fetches which exist on the west coasts.

abstract = {An urban energy and water balance model is presented which uses a small number of commonly measured meteorological variables and information about the surface cover. Rates of evaporation-interception for a single layer with multiple surface types (paved, buildings, coniferous trees and/or shrubs, deciduous trees and/or shrubs, irrigated grass, non-irrigated grass and water) are calculated. Below each surface type, except water, there is a single soil layer. At each time step the moisture state of each surface is calculated. Horizontal water movements at the surface and in the soil are incorporated. Particular attention is given to the surface conductance used to model evaporation and its parameters. The model is tested against direct flux measurements carried out over a number of years in Vancouver, Canada and Los Angeles, USA. At all measurement sites the model is able to simulate the net all-wave radiation and turbulent sensible and latent heat well (RMSE=25-47Wm-2, 30-64 and 20-56Wm-2, respectively). The model reproduces the diurnal cycle of the turbulent fluxes but typically underestimates latent heat flux and overestimates sensible heat flux in the day time. The model tracks measured surface wetness and simulates the variations in soil moisture content. It is able to respond correctly to short-term events as well as annual changes. The largest uncertainty relates to the determination of surface conductance. The model has the potential be used for multiple applications; for example, to predict effects of regulation on urban water use, landscaping and planning scenarios, or to assess climate mitigation strategies. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The extent and rate of global environmental changes, whether greenhouse gas-induced warming, deforestation, desertification, or loss in biodiversity, are driven largely by the rapid growth of the Earth's human population. Given the large and ever-increasing fraction of the world's population living in cities, and the disproportionate share of resources used by these urban residents, especially in the global North, cities and their inhabitants are key drivers of global environmental change. Here attention is directed to the impact of cities on climate. The focus is not on the effects of cities on global-scale climate, rather the effects globally of cities at regional and local scales. Distinct urban climates at these scales have long been recognized (dating back to Howard 1833). Locally, they are of greater magnitude than projected global-scale climate change and enhance the vulnerability of urban residents to future global environmental change. Moreover, interventions at these scales have the potential to mitigate broader environmental change both directly and indirectly. The links between urbanization and global climate change are complex (Sánchez-Rodríguez et al. 2005; Simon this issue). In the context of enhanced global warming, cities affect greenhouse gas sources and sinks both directly and indirectly. For instance, urban areas are the major sources of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels for heating and cooling; from industrial processes; transportation of people and goods, and so forth. Svirejeva-Hopkins et al. (2004) suggest that more than 90{\%} of anthropogenic carbon emissions are generated in cities. The clearing of land for cities and roads, and the demand for goods and resources by urban residents, both historically and today, are the major drivers of regional land use change, such as deforestation, which has reduced the magnitude of global carbon sinks. While predicting climate change and its impacts at a global scale is still highly uncertain, local effects of urbanization on the climate have long been documented (see descriptions in Landsberg 1981). Surface and atmospheric changes associated with the construction and functioning of cities are profound. New surface materials, associated with buildings, roads, and other infrastructure, along with changes to the morphology of the surface, alter energy and water exchanges and airflow. Combined with direct anthropogenic emissions of heat, carbon dioxide and pollutants, these result in distinct urban climates (Landsberg 1981; Oke 1997). One of the best-known urban effects of such development is urban warming; globally cities are almost always warmer than the surrounding rural area (Oke 1973). The magnitude of urban warming is highly variable over both time and space. On average, urban temperatures may be 1–3°C warmer, but under appropriate meteorological conditions (calm, cloud- less nights in winter) air temperatures can be more than 10°C warmer than surrounding rural environ- ments (Oke 1981). However, in some regional settings, for example in arid environments, cities with large amounts of irrigated greenspace (parks, suburban vegetation) may actually be cooler than the surround- ing dry areas (see the results of Grimmond et al. 1993, for example, for Sacramento, California, USA). The underlying physical causes of the urban heat island are complex (Table 1). For any neighbour- hood in any city, the relative balance of controls depends on the nature of the urban environment, human activity, and meteorological conditions. Urban climatologists commonly characterize the morphology of a city in terms of the height, width and density of buildings (see Figure 3, in which sky view factor is defined). These properties, in combi- nation, affect the loss of long wave radiation at night and therefore cooling rates, the solar access during the day and thus the diurnal pattern of heating, and airflow and wind speed at street level. While predicting climate change and its impacts at a global scale is still highly uncertain, local effects of urbanization on the climate have long been documented (see descriptions in Landsberg 1981).

These properties, in combi- nation, affect the loss of long wave radiation at night and therefore cooling rates, the solar access during the day and thus the diurnal pattern of heating, and airflow and wind speed at street level. The radiative, thermal and hydraulic properties of construction materials differ markedly from those of bare rock, soil, vegetation and water, their pre-existing counterparts. In many, though not all, cities the area covered by vegetation decreases. Thus the fraction of solar energy driving evapotran- spiration (the latent heat flux), rather than warming the urban fabric and air (the sensible heat fluxes), decreases. However, the properties of building materials differ widely (Plate 1). For example, roofing materials – asphalt tiles, ceramic tiles, thatch, slate, and corrugated steel/iron – have very different radia- tive properties (albedo, emissivity) and conductive properties (thermal admittance, conductivity) which greatly affect energy uptake and release and thus heating /cooling patterns. Other facets of buildings, for example, walls, are constructed of materials with equally different properties, which have profound effects on heating and cooling patterns and the resulting building and air temperatures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Characterizing intra-urban variation in air quality is important for epidemiological investigation of health outcomes and disparities. To date, however, few studies have been designed to capture spatial variation during select hours of the day, or to examine the roles of meteorology and complex terrain in shaping intra-urban exposure gradients.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We designed a spatial saturation monitoring study to target local air pollution sources, and to understand the role of topography and temperature inversions on fine-scale pollution variation by systematically allocating sampling locations across gradients in key local emissions sources (vehicle traffic, industrial facilities) and topography (elevation) in the Pittsburgh area. Street-level integrated samples of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone (O3) were collected during morning rush and probable inversion hours (6-11 AM), during summer and winter. We hypothesized that pollution concentrations would be: 1) higher under inversion conditions, 2) exacerbated in lower-elevation areas, and 3) vary by season.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: During July - August 2011 and January - March 2012, we observed wide spatial and seasonal variability in pollution concentrations, exceeding the range measured at regulatory monitors. We identified elevated concentrations of multiple pollutants at lower-elevation sites, and a positive association between inversion frequency and NO2 concentration. We examined temporal adjustment methods for deriving seasonal concentration estimates, and found that the appropriate reference temporal trend differs between pollutants.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our time-stratified spatial saturation approach found some evidence for modification of inversion-concentration relationships by topography, and provided useful insights for refining and interpreting GIS-based pollution source indicators for Land Use Regression modeling.},

abstract = {Surface urban heat island (SUHI) is a phenomenon of both high spatial and temporal variability. In this context, studying and monitoring the SUHIs of urban areas through the satellite remote sensing technology, requires land surface temperature (LST) image data from satellite-borne thermal sensors of high spatial resolution as well as temporal resolution. However, due to technical constrains, satellite-borne thermal sensors yield a trade-off between their spatial and temporal resolution; a high spatial resolution is associated with a low temporal resolution and vice versa. To resolve this drawback, we applied in this study four downscaling techniques using different scaling factors to downscale 1-km LST image data provided by the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) sensor, given that AVHRR can offer the highest temporal resolution currently available. The city of Athens in Greece was used as the application site. Downscaled 120-m AVHRR LSTs simulated by the downscaling techniques, were then used for SUHI intensity estimation based on LST differences observed between the main urban land covers of Athens and the city's rural background. For the needs of the study, land cover information for Athens was obtained from the Corine Land Cover (CLC) 2000 database for Greece. Validation of the downscaled 120-m AVHRR LSTs as well of the retrieved SUHI intensities was performed by comparative analysis with time-coincident observations of 120-m LST and SUHI intensities generated from the band 6 of the Thermal Mapper (TM) sensor onboard the Landsat 5 platform. The spatial pattern of the downscaled AVHRR LST was found to be visually improved when compared to that of the original AVHRR LST and to resemble more that of TM6 LST. Statistical results indicated that, when compared to 120-m TM6 LST, the root mean square error (RMSE) in 120-m AVHRR LST generated by the downscaling techniques ranged from 4.9 to 5.3????C. However, the accuracy in SUHI intensity was found to have significantly improved, with a RMSE value decreasing from 2.4????C when the original AVHRR LST was utilized, down to 0.94????C in case that downscaling was applied. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In order to identify open issues and gaps remaining in this field, we review research on SUHI/SUCI, the models for simulating UHIs/UCIs and techniques used in this field were appraised. The appraisal has revealed some great progress made in surface UHI mapping of cities located in humid and vegetated (temperate) regions, whilst few studies have investigated the spatiotemporal variation of surface SUHI/SUCI and the effect of land use/land cover (LULC) change on LST in arid and semi-arid climates.

abstract = {Over the past 60 years, metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona, has been among the fastest-growing urban areas in the United States, and this rapid urbanization has resulted in an urban heat island (UHI) of substantial size and intensity. During this time, an uncommon amount of UHI-specific research, relative to other cities in North America, occurred within its boundaries. This review investigates the possible reasons and motivations underpinning the large body of work, as well as summarizing specific themes, approaches, and theoretical contributions arising from such study. It is argued that several factors intrinsic to Phoenix were responsible for the prodigious output: strong applied urban climate research partnerships between several agencies (such as the academy, the National Weather Service, private energy firms, and municipal governments); a high-quality, long-standing network of urban meteorological stations allowing for relatively fine spatial resolution of near-surface temperature data; and a high level of public and media interest in the UHI. Three major research themes can be discerned: 1) theoretical contributions from documenting, modeling, and analyzing the physical characteristics of the UHI; 2) interdisciplinary investigation into its biophysical and social consequences; and 3) assessment and evaluation of several UHI mitigation techniques. Also examined herein is the successful implementation of sustainable urban climate policies within the metropolitan area. The authors note the importance of understanding and applying local research results during the policy formation process.},

abstract = {This article presents a conceptual model to investigate population migration as a possible adaptive response to risks associated with climate change. The model reflects established theories of human migration behaviour, and is based upon the concepts of vulnerability, exposure to risk and adaptive capacity, as developed in the climate change research community. The application of the model is illustrated using the case of 1930s migration patterns in rural Eastern Oklahoma, which took place during a period of repeated crop failures due to drought and flooding.},

The SYR also draws on the findings of the two Special Reports brought out in 2011 dealing with Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation, and Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation. The SYR, therefore, is a comprehensive up-to-date compilation of assessments dealing with climate change, based on the most recent scientific, technical and socio-economic literature in the field.},

@article{Hulley2012,
abstract = {Land surface temperature and emissivity (LST{\&}E) data are essential for a wide variety of surface-atmosphere studies, from calculating the evapotranspiration of the Earth's land surface to retrieving atmospheric water vapor. LST{\&}E products are generated from thermal infrared data acquired from sensors such as ASTER and MODIS on NASA's EOS platforms. NASA has identified a major need to develop long-term, consistent products valid across multiple missions, with well-defined uncertainty statistics addressing specific Earth science questions. These products are termed Earth System Data Records (ESDRs) and LST{\&}E have been identified as an important ESDR. Currently a lack of understanding in LST{\&}E uncertainties limits their usefulness in land surface and climate models. To address this issue, a LST{\&}E uncertainty simulator has been developed to quantify and model uncertainties for a variety of TIR sensors and LST algorithms. Using the simulator, uncertainties were estimated for the MODIS and ASTER TES algorithm, including water vapor scaling (WVS). These uncertainties were parameterized according to view angle and estimated total column water vapor for application to real data. The standard ASTER TES algorithm had a RMSE of 3.1 K (1.2 K with WVS), while the MODIS TES algorithm had a RMSE of 4.5 K (1.5 K with WVS). Accuracies in retrieved spectral emissivity for both sensors degraded with higher atmospheric water content, however, with WVS the emissivity uncertainties were reduced to {\textless}0.015. Accurately quantifying uncertainties in LST{\&}E products not only improves their utility and understanding but will also enable the data to be fused into long-term, well characterized ESDRs.},

The results obtained reveal important hot spot effects and differences of surface brightness temperatures varying between -5 and 7 K between nadir and off-nadir measurements, according to azimuth view angles. Acquisitions performed over the two areas also illustrate the impact of the surface structure and presence of vegetation on the hot spot.

This is a preliminary study aimed at (1) devising a method to detect and compare the local cool-island intensities of various urban parks; (2) verifying that this local cool-island intensity differs among parks; (3) determining whether this local cool-island intensity is related to park characteristics. Results from air-temperature measurements in and around 61 Taipei city parks showed that urban parks were on average cooler than their surroundings, confirming the term "urban cool-islands." However, approximately one-fifth of the parks were warmer than their urban surroundings. At noon in summer, parks with ???50{\%} paved coverage and little tree- and shrub-cover were on average warmer than their surroundings. Large parks were on average cooler than the smaller ones, but this relationship was non-linear. In Taipei, parks differed in their local cool-island intensity and this intensity can be related to park characteristics. Before further details concerning better planning and design approaches to mitigate urban heat-islands can be addressed, a neighborhood-scaled understanding of the urban microclimate is first needed as a basis. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Temperature data from 0.01- to 3-m heights observed during a bicycle traverse of the campus were combined with modeled spatial temperature data simulated from a three-dimensional microclimate model (ENVI-met 3.1). A distinct park cool island, with mean observed magnitudes of 0.7–3.6°C, was documented for both traverse and model data with larger cooling intensities measured closer to surface level. Modeled results possessed varying but generally reasonable accuracy in simulating both spatial and temporal temperature data, although some systematic errors exist. A combination of several factors, such as variations in surface thermal properties, urban geometry, building orientation, and soil moisture, was likely responsible for influencing differential urban and non-urban near-surface temperatures. A strong inversion layer up to 1 m over non-urban surfaces was detected, contrasting with near-neutral lapse rates over urban sur- faces. A key factor in the spatial expansion of the park cool island was the advection of cooler park air to adjacent urban surfaces, although this effect was mostly concentrated from 0- to 1-m heights over urban surfaces that were more exposed to the atmosphere.},

abstract = {The thermodynamic exchanges of the old city center of Marseilles during a summer period are analyzed with the SOLENE thermo-radiative model, using measurements of the UBL-ESCOMPTE experimental campaign in June-July 2001. The selected scene is an actual fragment of the urban canopy composed of 4 streets at right angles, with various 19th century houses and yards. The SOLENE software's ability to simulate the heat and radiation exchanges of this urban district with the atmosphere is first evaluated by comparing simulation outputs with surface temperatures of individual roof and fa??ade elements measured by infrared radiation thermometers and with integrated fluxes measured on top of a neighboring meteorological mast. This model assessment is reinforced by a sensitivity study to the interior building temperature, a variable of possible influence which is usually not measured in studies at the scale of an urban fragment or district. The flux sensor position influence on the comparison is also studied by introducing a virtual sensor in the simulated scene. The software is further used to analyze the behavior of individual surface elements of the scene with various orientations during a typical summer diurnal cycle. The contributions of the different surface classes (roofs, fa??ades, streets, yards) to the upward radiation and heat fluxes to the atmosphere are then detailed for several canopy morphologies (H/W). ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {New developments of the international community in modeling the urban canopy surface energy balance are presented and classified into five main categories: (i) models statistically fit to observations, (ii) and (iii) modified vegetation schemes with or without drag terms in the canopy, and (iv) and (v), new urban canopy schemes, that present both horizontal and vertical surfaces, again with or without a drag approach. The advantages and disadvantages of each type of model are explained. In general, the more the physics are correctly simulated, the more complex are the urban phenomenon that can be addressed, on the other hand however, the more consuming of computer-time and difficult to couple with atmospheric models the scheme becomes. Present use of these new models in meso-scale atmospheric models show their ability to reproduce the phenomenon of the urban heat island (UHI) and some of its consequences urban breezes, storm initiation, interaction with sea-breeze. Their use opens up new perspectives, for example in the mitigation of the UHI, or assessment of the role of air-conditioning systems or the impact of urban dynamics on air pollution. However, there is need to validate further the different urban models available. In particular it is necessary to compare model output with urban surface energy balance measurements. An intercomparison exercise involving these urban schemes is suggested as an efficient way to assess and improve these models.},

abstract = {Better communication both within the field of urban climate and between urban climate and cognate fields is necessary to both bind the subject internally and to more effectively move it into interdisciplinary interaction. A brief statement of the wide diversity of the field and its several modes of study and application leads to the view that it would be beneficial to consider adopting aids to increase dialogue. This includes standardization of sym- bols, terminology and indices, classification of phenomena, a protocol to generalize site description, adoption of principles of experimental design and the use of dimen- sional analysis and normalization to aid the transferability of results. The focus of this paper is how to facilitate scientific inter- action between participants within the field of urban climate, including both those who study its mechanisms and effects and those who apply such knowledge to the improvement of human settlements. As a by-product it may also assist com- munication between urban climatologists and workers in cognate fields as well as those we wish to entrain in the fields of policy development and environmental manage- ment. Section 1 explains the nature of the urban climate field and its practitioners, especially the diversity of scholarly disciplines, the range of topics studied and the motivations for doing so. Section 2 describes the sequence of investi- gative modes associated with achieving coherent understand- ing and intelligent application of urban climate. Section 3 attempts to outline some essential elements which might promote discourse between these modes such as the use of a common set of symbols and terminology and ways of expressing results so as to standardize variables and thereby assist comparison and transferability of results.},

abstract = {The relationship between the molecular struc- tures of a series of azo dyes and their operational performance when applied to dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) is probed via experimental and computational analysis. Seven azo dyes, with three different donating groups (dimethylamino, diethylamino, and dipropylamino) and carboxylic acid anchoring positions (ortho-, meta-, and para-substituted phenyl rings) are studied. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction is employed in order to analyze the effects of conformation and quantify the contribution of quinoidal resonance forms to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT), which controls their intrinsic photovoltaic potential from an electronic standpoint. Harmonic oscillator stabilization energy (HOSE) calculations indicate that the para-and ortho-azo dyes exhibit potential for DSSC application.However, froma geometrical standpoint, the crystal structure data, proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H NMR), and density functional theory (DFT) all indicate that intramolecular hydrogen bonds form in ortho-dyes within both solid and solution states, impeding their intrinsic ICT-based photovoltaic potential, and offering insights into the photostability of azo dyes and the dye{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}TiO2 anchoring mechanism in DSSCs. Donor effects are manifested in the packing mode and molecular planarity revealed by X-ray crystallography and in the UV/vis absorption spectra. DFT and time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) were performed to understand the electronic and optical properties of these azo dyes; these calculations compare well with experimental findings. Operational tests of DSSCs, functionalized by these azo dyes, show that the carboxylic acid anchoring position plays a crucial role in DSSC performance, while donating groups offer a much less obvious effect on the overall DSSC device efficiency.

For a better understanding of the spatial coherences of surface properties a land use classification was derived. The different classes were then spatially and temporally compared. The investigations show in the daytime a distinct surface cool island for Dubai and surface cool areas at Abu Dhabi city and its surrounding mangrove areas. Net radiation is mainly controlled by the albedo. The albedo in urban areas is lower than in their surrounding desert environments, therefore the net radiation is higher in the urban areas. The surface temperatures behave contrary to the net radiation and are higher in land use classes, where water is available.},

abstract = {1 Although drought frequency and severity are predicted to increase across numerous continental interiors, the consequences of these changes for dominant plants are largely unknown. Over the last decade, the south-western US has experienced six drought years, including the extreme droughts of 1996 and 2002, which led to widespread tree mortality across northern Arizona. 2 We examined the impact of these droughts on the co-dominant tree species of the pinyon-juniper woodland (Pinus edulis and Juniperus monosperma), a major vegetation type in the US. 3 Pinyon mortality following both droughts was 6.5-fold higher than juniper mortality. In addition, large pinyons suffered 2-6-fold greater mortality than small pinyons, a pattern associated with higher mortality of reproductively mature trees and survival of smaller pinyons resulting from facilitation by established vegetation. Differential mortality of large pinyons resulted in a vegetation shift such that the pinyon-juniper woodlands are becoming dominated by juniper, a species that is typical of lower elevations and more arid conditions. 4 Sites that experienced high pinyon mortality during the first drought suffered additional mortality during the second drought, so that reductions in tree densities and the resulting release from below-ground competition did not buffer surviving pinyons against additional mortality during the second drought. Such repeated mortality events also suggest that these stands may suffer chronic stress. 5 Reductions in biotic associations (e.g. avian seed dispersers, ectomycorrhizas and nurse plants) that will probably result from extreme mortality of large pinyons ensure that the observed vegetation shifts will be persistent. Because approximately 1000 species are associated with pinyon pine, the shift in the structure of these woodlands has large-scale community consequences.},

Spectral properties of urban surface materials are presented and interpreted, and their separability is systematically analyzed using the Bhattacharyya distance (B-distance) as a quantitative measure of spectral discrimination. We find considerable spectral confusion between urban land cover types (i.e. specific roof and road types) but also show the potential of fine spectral-resolution remote sensing for detailed mapping of urban materials and their condition based on their spectral signal. An evaluation of the most suitable wavelengths for separation of urban land cover identified specific spectral features that provided the best separation. There is a strong indication that current multispectral systems, including IKONOS and LANDSAT ETM+, provide only marginal abilities to resolve these important features and are limited for urban land-cover mapping. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The extinction event coincided with a large asteroid impact at Chicxulub, Mexico, and occurred within the time of Deccan flood basalt volcanism in India. Here, we synthesize records of the global stratigraphy across this boundary to assess the proposed causes of the mass extinction. Notably, a single ejecta-rich deposit compositionally linked to the Chicxulub impact is globally distributed at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. The temporal match between the ejecta layer and the onset of the extinctions and the agreement of ecological patterns in the fossil record with modeled environmental perturbations (for example, darkness and cooling) lead us to conclude that the Chicxulub impact triggered the mass extinction.},

abstract = {Climate scenarios serve a number of functions in helping society manage climate change-pedagogic, motivational or practical (for example, in engineering design, spatial planning and policy development). A variety of methodologies for scenario construction have been experimented with, all of them to a greater or lesser extent depending on the use of climate models. Yet the development of climate scenarios involves much more than climate modelling. The process of scenario development is one of negotiation between relevant stakeholders-funding agencies, policy communities, scientists, social actors and decision-makers in a variety of sectors. This process of negotiation is illustrated through an analysis of four generations of UK climate scenarios-published in 1991, 1996, 1998 and 2002. Using ideas from science and technology studies and the sociology of scientific knowledge to guide our analysis, we reveal complex relationships between the interests of UK science, policy and society. Negotiating climate scenarios involves compromise between the needs of policy, science and decision-maker in relation to, for example, the selection of the development pathway(s) and emissions scenario(s), the choice of climate model(s), the assessment and communication of uncertainty and the presentational devices used. These insights have a significant bearing on the way in which climate scenarios should be viewed and used in public discourse, strategic planning and policy development. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Brightness temperatures were derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) at channel 4 (10.5-11.5 [mu]m) on the NOAA-9 and NOAA-10 satellites to examine the applicability of the AVHRR thermal data to the study of urban heat islands. Air and ground surface temperatures measured at meteorological stations in large cities (population over 300,000) in South Korea were compared with in situ brightness temperature data. The correlation coefficient between air temperatures and brightness temperatures is 0.85 and the relationship may be expressed by the regression: AT=0.59 BT + 2.54. This equation explains 73{\%} of variances at the 0.02{\%} significance level. The best-fit line, however, underestimates air temperatures in such heat-processing industrial cities as Ulsan and Pohang, where smoke puffs up from the high stacks of industrial plants, and overestimates them in the Seoul metropolitan area. The regression equation of ground surface temperatures on brightness temperatures explains 72{\%} of variances. Assuming that optimal meteorological conditions can be selected, the regression equation can be used as a tool to assess air temperature fields in cities. Urban land-use, such as built-up, residential and industrial areas, was clearly identified from the AVHRR thermal data, while small-scale land-use, like parks, were not distinguishable. Brightness temperatures for the intensity of heat islands were related to the population size of cities. The areal magnitude of heat islands in the Seoul metropolitan area expanded considerably, reflecting the conurbation trend for the period 1986-1989. Urban temperatures in the area increased during the period, while temperature gradients declined.},

abstract = {A unique set of nocturnal longwave radiative and sensible heat flux divergences was obtained during the 1999 Cooperative Atmosphere-Surface Exchange Study (CASES-99). These divergences are based on upward and downward longwave radiation measurements at two levels and turbulent eddy correlation measurements at eight levels. In contrast to previous radiation divergence measurements obtained within 10 m above the ground, radiative flux divergence was measured within a deeper layer-between 2 and 48 m. Within the layer, the radiative flux divergence is, on average, comparable to or smaller than the sensible heat flux divergence. The horizontal and vertical temperature advection, derived as the residual in the heat balance using observed sensible heat and radiative fluxes, are found to be significant terms in the heat balance at night. The observations also indicate that the radiative flux divergence between 2 and 48 m was typically largest in the early evening. Its magnitude depends on how fast the ground cools and on how large the vertical temperature gradient is within the layer. A radiative flux difference of more than 10 W m(-2) over 46 m of height was observed under weak-wind and clear-sky conditions after hot days. Wind speed variation can change not only the sensible heat transfer but also the surface longwave radiation because of variations of the area exposure of the warmer grass stems and soil surfaces versus the cooler grass blade tips, leading to fluctuations of the radiative flux divergence throughout the night.},

Here we use two paleoclimate reconstructions of drought and precipitation for Central and Southern California to place this current event in the context of the last millennium. We demonstrate that while 3 year periods of persistent below-average soil moisture are not uncommon, the current event is the most severe drought in the last 1200 years, with single year (2014) and accumulated moisture deficits worse than any previous continuous span of dry years. Tree ring chronologies extended through the 2014 growing season reveal that precipitation during the drought has been anomalously low but not outside the range of natural variability. The current California drought is exceptionally severe in the context of at least the last millennium and is driven by reduced though not unprecedented precipitation and record high temperatures.

We use atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration as a single, simple indicator to track the progression of the Anthropocene. From a preindustrial value of 270-275 ppm, atmospheric carbon dioxide had risen to about 310 ppm by 1950. Since then the human enterprise has experienced a remarkable explosion, the Great Acceleration, with significant consequences for Earth System functioning. Atmospheric CO2 concentration has risen from 310 to 380 ppm since 1950, with about half of the total rise since the preindustrial era occurring in just the last 30 years. The Great Acceleration is reaching criticality. Whatever unfolds, the next few decades will surely be a tipping point in the evolution of the Anthropocene.},

Results are compared with a regression ´dz model based on incoming solar radiation and with an urban canopy-layer model incorporating a canyon geometry radiation scheme that requires a larger set of meteorological and surface property inputs. This net all-wave radiation parameterization (NARP) is most sensitive to albedo and the effects of clouds on incoming longwave radiation. Although omitting the diurnal variation of albedo has little impact on overall model fit, its seasonal variability needs to be considered in some cases. For incoming longwave radiation, even clear-sky estimates show a large degree of scatter, and results degrade substantially if cloudy periods are included. NARP shows improvement over the regression approach. If observations of downwelling longwave radiation are included, NARP and the more complex canopy scheme show similar results, near or within the range of instrument error, depending of time of year. 1.},

abstract = {The Canadian urban and land surface external modeling system (known as urban GEM-SURF) has been developed to provide surface and near-surface meteorological variables to improve numerical weather prediction and to become a tool for environmental applications. The system is based on the Town Energy Balance model for the built-up covers and on the Interactions between the Surface, Biosphere, and Atmosphere land surface model for the natural covers. It is driven by coarse-resolution forecasts from the 15-km Canadian regional operational model. This new system was tested for a 120-m grid-size computational domain covering the Montreal metropolitan region from 1 May to 30 September 2008. The numerical results were first evaluated against local observations of the surface energy budgets, air temperature, and humidity taken at the Environmental Prediction in Canadian Cities (EPiCC) field experiment tower sites. As compared with the regional deterministic 15-km model, important improvements have been achieved with this system over urban and suburban sites. GEM-SURF's ability to simulate the Montreal surface urban heat island was also investigated, and the radiative surface temperatures from this system and from two systems operational at the Meteorological Service of Canada were compared, that is, the 15-km regional deterministic model and the so-called limited-area model with 2.5-km grid size. Comparison of urban GEM-SURF outputs with remotely sensed observations from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) reveals relatively good agreement for urban and natural areas.

abstract = {This paper presents a survey of the empirical literature studying the relationship between health outcomes, temperature, and adaptation to temperature extremes. The objectives of the paper are to highlight the many remaining gaps in the empirical literature and to provide guidelines for improving the current Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) literature that seeks to incorporate human health and adaptation in its framework. I begin by presenting the conceptual and methodological issues associated with the measurement of the effect of temperature extremes on health, and the role of adaptation in possibly muting these effects. The main conclusion that emerges from the literature is that despite the wide variety of data sets and settings most studies find that temperature extremes lead to significant reductions in health, generally measured with excess mortality. Regarding the role of adaptation in mitigating the effects of extreme temperature on health, the available knowledge is limited, in part due to the few real-world data sets on adaptation behaviors. Finally, the paper discusses the implications of the currently available evidence for assessments of potential human health impacts of global climate change.},

Historically, these were based on physiological, structural and/or phenological properties, whereas recently, they have reflected plant responses to resources or environmental conditions. Often, an underlying assumption, based on an economic analogy, is that the functional role of vegetation can be identified by linked sets of morphological and physiological traits constrained by resources, based on the hypothesis of functional convergence. Using these concepts, ecologists have defined a variety of functional traits that are often context dependent, and the diversity of proposed traits demonstrates the lack of agreement on universal categories. Historically, remotely sensed data have been interpreted in ways that parallel these observations, often focused on the categorization of vegetation into discrete types, often dependent on the sampling scale. At the same time, current thinking in both ecology and remote sensing has moved towards viewing vegetation as a continuum rather than as discrete classes. The capabilities of new remote sensing instruments have led us to propose a new concept of optically distinguishable functional types (‘optical types') as a unique way to address the scale dependence of this problem. This would ensure more direct relationships between ecological information and remote sensing observations.},

Besides very detailed field measurements of the structure and dynamics of the urban boundary layer, a series of satellite data has been analyzed and validated. Satellite data from MODIS, NOAA-AVHRR (14, 15, and 16) and Landsat-ETM were used and recorded during June and July 2002 in parallel to the BUBBLE field campaign. MODIS and NOAA-AVHRR data represent day and nighttime surface radiation temperatures in 930??m and 1100??m grid size. Landsat-ETM offers a unique resolution on 60??m, but with only daytime imagery at about the same time of MODIS overpass is available. This enables the validation of satellite measurements from different sensors with ground measurements at locations with various degrees of spatial homogeneity/heterogeneity (urban/rural land use). Several different algorithms for NOAA-AVHRR data were compared with in-situ measurements. The results show a very high correlation of the long wave emissions measured by the satellite with the in-situ measurements showing an accuracy of ?? 3{\%} to 5{\%} on average, even in urban environments. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

4, where ?? is the surface emissivity, ?? is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and Tr is the measured radiometric temperature. ????Tr
4 differs from hemispheric emission because the measured radiometric temperature is anisotropic for an uneven surface. This paper analyzes the anisotropy-related error in measurements of longwave radiation flux from a building canopy. The flux difference between ????Tr
4 and directly measured flux was up to 8{\%} of the directly measured flux, which could be greater than the typical error in measurement of turbulent heat flux over a building canopy. The flux difference increased as the temperature variation within the urban street canyon increased, and also with increasing difference between the incident solar radiation of the building walls and street canyon floors (pavement, roads, ground surface). Theoretical calculations indicate that the flux difference is due to the structure of the building canopy and the temperature difference between the walls and canopy floors. A numerical model of a building canopy heat budget shows that the flux difference increases as the street canyon aspect ratio increases. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

When the difference between in situ and AVHRR surface temperatures was smaller than the uncertainty, the model was judged to be adequate.

abstract = {We synthesize insights from current understanding of drought impacts at stand-to-biogeographic scales, including management options, and we identify challenges to be addressed with new research. Large stand-level shifts underway in western forests already are showing the importance of interactions involving drought, insects, and fire. Diebacks, changes in composition and structure, and shifting range limits are widely observed. In the eastern US, the effects of increasing drought are becoming better understood at the level of individual trees, but this knowledge cannot yet be confidently translated to predictions of changing structure and diversity of forest stands. While eastern forests have not experienced the types of changes seen in western forests in recent decades, they too are vulnerable to drought and could experience significant changes with increased severity, frequency, or duration in drought. Throughout the continental United States, the combination of projected large climate-induced shifts in suitable habitat from modeling studies and limited potential for the rapid migration of tree populations suggests that changing tree and forest biogeography could substantially lag habitat shifts already underway. Forest management practices can partially ameliorate drought impacts through reductions in stand density, selection of drought-tolerant species and genotypes, artificial regeneration, and the development of multistructured stands. However, silvicultural treatments also could exacerbate drought impacts unless implemented with careful attention to site and stand characteristics. Gaps in our understanding should motivate new research on the effects of interactions involving climate and other species at the stand scale and how interactions and multiple responses are represented in models. This assessment indicates that, without a stronger empirical basis for drought impacts at the stand scale, more complex models may provide limited guidance.},

abstract = {The spatial resolution of meteorological observations of scalars (such as concentrations or temperature) and scalar fluxes (e.g., water-vapour flux, sensible heat flux) above inhomogeneous surfaces is in general not known. It is determined by the surface area of influence or source area of the sensor, which for sensors of quantities that are subject to turbulent diffusion, depends on the flow and turbulence conditions. Functions describing the relationship between the spatial distribution of surface sources (or sinks) and a measured signal at height in the surface layer have been termed the footprint function or the source weight function, In this paper, the source area of level P is defined as the integral of the source weight function over the smallest possible domain comprising the fraction P of the total surface influence reflected in the measured signal. Source area models for scalar concentration and for passive scalar fluxes are presented. The results of the models are presented as characteristic dimensions of the P = 50{\%} source areas (i.e., the area responsible for 50{\%} of the surface influence): the maximum source location (i.e., the upwind distance of the surface element with the maximum-weight influence), the near and the far end of the source area, and its maximal lateral extension. These numerical model results are related directly to non-dimensional surface-layer scaling variables by a non-linear least squares method in a parameterized model which provides a user-friendly estimate of the surface area responsible for measured concentrations or fluxes, The source area models presented here allow conclusions to be made about the spatial representativeness and the localness (these terms are defined in the text) of flux and concentration measurements.},

abstract = {Urban heat island is among the most evident aspects of human impacts on the earth system. Here we assess the diurnal and seasonal variation of surface urban heat island intensity (SUHII) defined as the surface temperature difference between urban area and suburban area measured from the MODIS. Differences in SUHII are analyzed across 419 global big cities, and we assess several potential biophysical and socio-economic driving factors. Across the big cities, we show that the average annual daytime SUHII (1.5 ± 1.2 °C) is higher than the annual nighttime SUHII (1.1 ± 0.5 °C) (P {\textless} 0.001). But no correlation is found between daytime and nighttime SUHII across big cities (P = 0.84), suggesting different driving mechanisms between day and night. The distribution of nighttime SUHII correlates positively with the difference in albedo and nighttime light between urban area and suburban area, while the distribution of daytime SUHII correlates negatively across cities with the difference of vegetation cover and activity between urban and suburban areas. Our results emphasize the key role of vegetation feedbacks in attenuating SUHII of big cities during the day, in particular during the growing season, further highlighting that increasing urban vegetation cover could be one effective way to mitigate the urban heat island effect.},

abstract = {Mitigation of the urban heat island (UHI) effect at the city-scale is investigated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model in conjunction with the Princeton Urban Canopy Model (PUCM). Specifically, the cooling impacts of green roof and cool (white/highalbedo) roof strategies over the Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area during a heat wave period (7 June–10 June 2008) are assessed using the optimal set-up of WRF-PUCM described in the companion paper by Li and Bou-Zeid (2014). Results indicate that the surface UHI effect (defined based on the urban–rural surface temperature difference) is reduced significantly more than the near-surface UHI effect (defined based on urban–rural 2 m air temperature difference) when these mitigation strategies are adopted. In addition, as the green and cool roof fractions increase, the surface and near-surface UHIs are reduced almost linearly. Green roofs with relatively abundant soil moisture have comparable effect in reducing the surface and near-surface UHIs to cool roofs with an albedo value of 0.7. Significant indirect effects are also observed for both green and cool roof strategies; mainly, the low-level advection of atmospheric moisture from rural areas into urban terrain is enhanced when the fraction of these roofs increases, thus increasing the humidity in urban areas. The additional benefits or penalties associated with modifications of the main physical determinants of green or cool roof performance are also investigated. For green roofs, when the soil moisture is increased by irrigation, additional cooling effect is obtained, especially when the ‘unmanaged' soil moisture is low. The effects of changing the albedo of cool roofs are also substantial. These results also underline the capabilities of the WRF-PUCM framework to support detailed analysis and diagnosis of the UHI phenomenon, and of its different mitigation strategies.},

abstract = {Despite some notable exceptions, relatively little of the large body of knowledge concerning urban climate has permeated through to working planners. This lack of application has been bemoaned by climatologists for many years. The reasons for this state of affairs are many, but amongst those most cited are the inherent complexity of the subject, its interdisciplinary nature and lack of meaningful dialogue between planners and the climatological research community. Whilst this is true, these potential barriers have not prevented application of knowledge from parallel disciplines by planners, nor the adoption of climatological principles by architects and engineers at the building scale. The paper reviews the possibility that part of the problem is attributable to the nature of research in urban climatology and the difficulty of translating its results into robust tools for application. A critical assessment of the preparedness of urban climatology to be an applied science reveals progress and promise but also weaknesses. The latter include a lack of quantitative techniques and relationships, lack of standardization, generality and transferability, and the absence of clear guidelines for those wishing to learn and use climatological principles in settlement planning. There is also a dearth of first-hand information from the low latitudes which must be filled if climate is to play a significant role in planning the massive urbanization which is under way there. {\textcopyright} 1984.},

abstract = {Martilli's urban parameterization scheme is improved and implemented in a mesoscale model in order to take into account the typical effects of a real city on the air temperature near the ground and on the surface exchange fluxes. The mesoscale model is run on a single column using atmospheric data and radiation recorded above roof level as forcing. Here, the authors validate Martilli's urban boundary layer scheme using measurements from two mid-latitude European cities: Basel, Switzerland and Marseilles, France. For Basel, the model performance is evaluated with observations of canyon temperature, surface radiation, and energy balance fluxes obtained during the Basel urban boundary layer experiment (BUBBLE). The results show that the urban parameterization scheme represents correctly most of the behavior of the fluxes typical of the city center of Basel, including the large heat uptake by the urban fabric and the positive sensible heat flux at night. For Marseilles, the model performance is evaluated with observations of surface temperature, canyon temperature, surface radiation, and energy balance fluxes collected during the field experiments to constrain models of atmospheric pollution and transport of emissions (ESCOMPTE) and its urban boundary layer (UBL) campaign. At both urban sites, vegetation cover is less than 20{\%}, therefore, particular attention was directed to the ability of Martilli's urban boundary layer scheme to reproduce the observations for the Marseilles city center, where the urban parameters and the synoptic forcing are totally different from Basel. Evaluation of the model with wall, road, and roof surface temperatures gave good results. The model correctly simulates the net radiation, canyon temperature, and the partitioning between the turbulent and storage heat fluxes.},

abstract = {Dierences between the temperature of vegetated urban parks and that of their surrounding built environment are reported. The study is based on observations of surface and air temperature in Vancouver, BC and Sacramento, CA. during summer conditions. A combination of remotely sensed surface temper- ature and air temperature from {\textregistered}xed station and mobile (car and bicycle) traverses is used to characterize the magnitude of park-induced coolnessÐthe `park cool island' (PCI) eect. Relatively large surface PCI are present by day and at night, although for dierent reasons. Air temperature eects are smaller. In Vancouver, parks are typically 1±2 {\ss}C, but in ideal conditions can be almost 5 {\ss}C cooler than their surroundings. Larger PCI are possible in Sacramento where irrigated green- space can be 5±7 {\ss}C cooler. Park type, especially the extent of irrigation and the presence of trees, is important in PCI development. During the day trees may play an important role in establishing a cool park eect, perhaps through a combination of shade and evaporative cooling. At night it appears that the surface geometry and moisture status of the park are important controls on surface cooling. Open parks (with higher sky view factors) that have dry soils (and hence lower thermal admittance) cool the most. Nocturnal cooling in open grass parks is often similar to that at rural sites. The in¯uence of parks on air temperatures appears to be restricted to a distance of about one park width.},

abstract = {e paper demonstrates the relationship existing between the size of a village, town or city (as measured by its population), and the magnitude of the urban heat island it produces. This is accomplished by analyzing data gathered by automobile traverses in 10 settlements on the St. Lawrence Lowland, whose populations range from 1000 to 2 million inhabitants. The locations of these settlements effectively eliminate all non-urban climatic influences. The results are compared with previously published data. The analysis shows the heat island intensity under cloudless skies to be related to the inverse of the regional windspeed, and the logarithm of the population. A simple model is derived which incorporates these controls. In agreement with an extension of Summers' model the heat island appears to be approximately proportional to the fourth root of the population. With calm and clear conditions the relation is shown to hold remarkably well for North American settlements, and in a slightly modified form, for European towns and cities.},

abstract = {Many inhabitants of cities throughout the world suffer from health problems and discomfort that are caused by overheating of urban areas, and there is compelling evidence that these problems will be exacerbated by global climate change. Most cities are not designed to ameliorate these effects although it is well-known that this is possible, especially through evidence-based climate-responsive design of urban open spaces. Urban parks and green spaces have the potential to provide thermally comfortable environments and help reduce vulnerability to heat stress. However, in order for them to provide this function, parks must be designed within the context of the prevailing climate and predicted future climates. To analyze the effects of elements that alter microclimate in parks, we used human energy budget simulations. We modelled the outdoor human energy budget in a range of warm to hot climate zones and interpreted the results in terms of thermal comfort and health vulnerability. Reduction of solar radiant input with trees had the greatest effect in all test cities. Reduction in air temperature was the second-most important component, and in some climates was nearly as important as incorporating shade. We then conducted similar modelling using predicted climates for the middle of the century, emphasizing the importance of city-level efforts for park design to assist in minimizing future climate-related urban health risks. These simulations suggested that heat waves in many climates will produce outdoor environments where people will be in extreme danger of heat stress, but that appropriately designed parks can reduce the threat.},

abstract = {Remote sensing of urban heat islands (UHIs) has traditionally used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as the indicator of vegetation abundance to estimate the land surface temperature (LST)-vegetation relationship. This study investigates the applicability of vegetation fraction derived from a spectral mixture model as an alternative indicator of vegetation abundance. This is based on examination of a Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image of Indianapolis City, IN, USA, acquired on June 22, 2002. The transformed ETM+ image was unmixed into three fraction images (green vegetation, dry soil, and shade) with a constrained least-square solution. These fraction images were then used for land cover classification based on a hybrid classification procedure that combined maximum likelihood and decision tree algorithms. Results demonstrate that LST possessed a slightly stronger negative correlation with the unmixed vegetation fraction than with NDVI for all land cover types across the spatial resolution (30 to 960 m). Correlations reached their strongest at the 120-m resolution, which is believed to be the operational scale of LST, NDVI, and vegetation fraction images. Fractal analysis of image texture shows that the complexity of these images increased initially with pixel aggregation and peaked around 120 m, but decreased with further aggregation. The spatial variability of texture in LST was positively correlated with those in NDVI and in vegetation fraction. The interplay between thermal and vegetation dynamics in the context of different land cover types leads to the variations in spectral radiance and texture in LST. These variations are also present in the other imagery, and are responsible for the spatial patterns of urban heat islands. It is suggested that the areal measure of vegetation abundance by unmixed vegetation fraction has a more direct correspondence with the radiative, thermal, and moisture properties of the Earth's surface that determine LST. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {We have lived under the hegemony of the reductionistic scientific worldview since Galileo, Newton, and Laplace. In this view, the universe is meaningless, as Stephen Weinberg famously said, and organisms and a court of law are "nothing but" particles in morion. This scientific view is inadequate. Physicists are beginning to abandon reductionism in favor of emergence. Emergence, both epistemological and ontological, embraces the emergence of life and of agency. With agency comes meaning, value, and doing, beyond mere happenings. More organisms are conscious. None of this violates any laws of physics, but it cannot be reduced to physics. Emergence is real, and the tiger chasing the gazelle are real parts of the real universe. We live, therefore, in an emergent universe. This emergence often is entirely unpredictable beforehand, from the evolution of novel functionalities in organisms to the evolution of the economy and human history. We are surrounded on all sides by a creativity that cannot even be prestated. Thus we have the first glimmerings of a new scientific worldview, beyond reductionism. In our universe emergence is real, and there is ceaseless, stunning creativity that has given rise to our biosphere, our humanity, and our history. We are partial co-creators of this emergent creativity. It is our choice whether we use the God word. I believe it is wise to do so. God can be our shared name for the true creativity in the natural universe. Such a view invites a new sense of the sacred, as those aspects of the creativity in the universe that we deem worthy of holding sacred. We are not logically forced to this view. Yet a global civilization, hopefully persistently diverse and creative, is emerging. I believe we need a shared view of God, a fully natural God, to orient our lives.

abstract = {Enhanced aeolian supply of iron to the biota of the Southern Ocean during glacial periods is suspected to be an important contributory mechanism to the concurrently low observed mixing ratios of atmospheric CO2. Declining rates of dust deposition prior to the glacial terminations may be critical in driving the initial deglacial rise in CO2, but the reasons behind the dust decline itself are as yet unknown. Here we show that the dust record from the Vostok ice core can be qualitatively derived from a few general assumptions regarding the formation and aging of Patagonian sources of aeolian material and the efficiency with which it is transported through the atmosphere. We suggest that during glacial periods this dust supply becomes particularly sensitive to changes in global climate and that, in turn, climate is responsive to the dust due to iron fertilization. This positive feedback may mean that during glacial periods the carbon cycle exhibits two quasi steady states, characterized by distinct CO2 concentrations. Recognition of this “glacial subcycle” may help to account for the timing and sequence of events at the terminations.},

abstract = {This study presents an attempt to resolve fluctuations in surface temperatures at scales of a few seconds to several minutes using time-sequential ther- mography (TST) from a ground-based platform. A scheme is presented to decompose a TST dataset into fluctuating, high-frequency, and long-term mean parts. To demonstrate the scheme's application, a set of four TST runs (day/night, leaves-on/leaves-off) recorded from a 125-m-high platform above a complex urban environment in Berlin, Germany is used. Fluctuations in surface temperatures of different urban facets are measured and related to surface properties (mater- ial and form) and possible error sources. A number of relationships were found: (1) Surfaces with sur- face temperatures that were significantly different from air temperature experienced the highest fluctuations. (2) With increasing surface temperature above (be- low) air temperature, surface temperature fluctuations experienced a stronger negative (positive) skewness. (3) Surface materials with lower thermal admittance (lawns, leaves) showed higher fluctuations than sur- faces with high thermal admittance (walls, roads). (4) Surface temperatures of emerged leaves fluctuate more compared to trees in a leaves-off situation. (5) In many cases, observed fluctuations were coherent across several neighboring pixels. The evidence from (1) to (5) suggests that atmospheric turbulence is a significant contributor to fluctuations. The study underlines the potential of using high-frequency thermal remote sens- ing in energy balance and turbulence studies at complex land–atmosphere interfaces.},

abstract = {'Urban greening' has been proposed as one approach to mitigate the human health consequences of increased temperatures resulting from climate change. We used systematic review methodology to evaluate available evidence on whether greening interventions, such as tree planting or the creation of parks or green roofs, affect the air temperature of an urban area. Most studies investigated the air temperature within parks and beneath trees and are broadly supportive that green sites can be cooler than non-green sites. Meta-analysis was used to synthesize data on the cooling effect of parks and results show that, on average, a park was 0.94 ??C cooler in the day. Studies on multiple parks suggest that larger parks and those with trees could be cooler during the day. However, evidence for the cooling effect of green space is mostly based on observational studies of small numbers of green sites. The impact of specific greening interventions on the wider urban area, and whether the effects are due to greening alone, has yet to be demonstrated. The current evidence base does not allow specific recommendations to be made on how best to incorporate greening into an urban area. Further empirical research is necessary in order to efficiently guide the design and planning of urban green space, and specifically to investigate the importance of the abundance, distribution and type of greening. Any urban greening programme implemented would need to be appropriately designed and monitored to continue to evaluate benefit to human health through reducing temperature. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The urban heat island effect is especially significant in semi-arid climates, generating a myriad of problems for large urban areas. Green space can mitigate warming, providing cooling benefits important to reducing energy consumption and improving human health. The arrangement of green space to reap the full potential of cooling benefits is a challenge, especially considering the diurnal variations of urban heat island effects. Surprisingly, methods that support the strategic placement of green space in the context of urban heat island are lacking. Integrating geographic information systems, remote sensing, spatial statistics and spatial optimization, we developed a framework to identify the best locations and configuration of new green space with respect to cooling benefits. The developed multi-objective model is applied to evaluate the diurnal cooling trade-offs in Phoenix, Arizona. As a result of optimal green space placement, significant cooling potentials can be achieved. A reduction of land surface temperature of approximately 1–2 °C locally and 0.5 °C regionally can be achieved by the addition of new green space. 96{\%} of potential day and night cooling benefits can be achieved through simultaneous consideration. The results also demonstrate that clustered green space enhances local cooling because of the agglomeration effect; whereas, dispersed patterns lead to greater overall regional cooling. The optimization based framework can effectively inform planning decisions with regard to green space allocation to best ameliorate excessive heat.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heatwaves present a significant health risk and the hazard is likely to escalate with the increased future temperatures presently predicted by climate change models. The impact of heatwaves is often felt strongest in towns and cities where populations are concentrated and where the climate is often unintentionally modified to produce an urban heat island effect; where urban areas can be significantly warmer than surrounding rural areas. The purpose of this interdisciplinary study is to integrate remotely sensed urban heat island data alongside commercial social segmentation data via a spatial risk assessment methodology in order to highlight potential heat health risk areas and build the foundations for a climate change risk assessment. This paper uses the city of Birmingham, UK as a case study area. RESULTS: When looking at vulnerable sections of the population, the analysis identifies a concentration of "very high" risk areas within the city centre, and a number of pockets of "high risk" areas scattered throughout the conurbation. Further analysis looks at household level data which yields a complicated picture with a considerable range of vulnerabilities at a neighbourhood scale. CONCLUSIONS: The results illustrate that a concentration of "very high" risk people live within the urban heat island, and this should be taken into account by urban planners and city centre environmental managers when considering climate change adaptation strategies or heatwave alert schemes. The methodology has been designed to be transparent and to make use of powerful and readily available datasets so that it can be easily replicated in other urban areas.},

abstract = {The influence of vegetation on the urban climate was studied in the subtropical city Gaborone, the rapidly expanding capital of Botswana with approximately 200 000 inhabitants. Temperature records from an urban and a rural station were analysed for the period 1985–96. In an attempt to explain possible seasonal change in vegetation, NOAA satellite normalized difference vegetation index imagery was analysed. The present urban influence was investigated with temperature loggers at selected urban and rural sites. In addition, mobile measurements revealed spatial patterns in temperature and humidity for different land uses. Seasonal patterns of urban–rural differences in minimum temperatures emerge during the period 1994–96, especially during the winter when the heat island effect is largest. It is shown that differences in urban and rural vegetation over the year partly explain this variation. Mobile measurements reveal a weak nocturnal heat island of 2–3 °C during clear and calm nights. There are intra-urban temperature differences that are in the same range as the urban–rural relationship due to the role of vegetation. Evapotranspiration lowers the temperature, which was detected by high humidity in areas of lush vegetation. This becomes apparent at midday, when densely vegetated areas were up to 2 °C cooler than rural sites. An oasis effect, therefore, only exists on a highly local basis. In contrast, parts of the city with sparse vegetation are warmer than the countryside. There is an apparent opposed effect of rural and urban vegetation, whereby the former is hindering the temperature from falling and the latter is cooling the environment through evapotranspiration. This can be explained by the overwhelming amounts of imported water in the city promoting evaporative cooling},

abstract = {This article provides a description of a land surface temperature (LST) data set generated (and provided in near-real-time or offline) based on infrared data from sen- sors onboard different geostationary (GEO) satellites: Meteosat Second Generation (MSG), Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), and Multifunction Transport Satellite (MTSAT). Given the different characteristics of the imagers onboard each GEO platform, different algorithmic methodologies for the retrieval of LST are presented and implemented – namely the Generalized Split-Window (GSW) algo- rithm and the Dual Algorithm (DA) in its mono- and dual-channel forms – using semi-empirical functions that relate LST to top-of-atmosphere brightness temperatures in infrared window channels. The assumptions and physics underlying each method- ology, as well as the uncertainties of LST estimates, are discussed. The formulations are trained using a data set of radiative transfer simulations for a wide range of atmo- spheric and surface conditions. The performance of each algorithm is then assessed by comparing its output against an independent set of simulations, suggesting that prod- uct uncertainties range from 2◦C (for GSW and the two-channel algorithm) to 4◦C (for the one-channel algorithm). Finally, LST retrievals from different GEO satellites are merged into a single field. In overlapping areas, the average discrepancies between LST products derived from GOES and from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) onboard MSG are within 1◦C during night-time, but may reach 3◦C during daytime. Over those areas, the merged LST field is obtained as a weighted aver- age of available LST retrievals for the same time slot, taking into account the respective error bar.},

abstract = {High-resolution numerical simulations of the urban heat island (UHI) effect with the widely-used Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model are assessed. Both the sensitivity of the results to the simulation setup, and the quality of the simulated fields as representations of the real world, are investigated. Results indicate that the WRF-simulated surface temperatures are more sensitive to the planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme choice during nighttime, and more sensitive to the surface thermal roughness length parameterization during daytime. The urban surface temperatures simulated by WRF are also highly sensitive to the urban canopy model (UCM) used. The implementation in this study of an improved UCM (the Princeton UCM or PUCM) that allows the simulation of heterogeneous urban facets and of key hydrological processes, together with the so-called CZ09 parameterization for the thermal roughness length, significantly reduce the bias ({\textless}1.5 °C) in the surface temperature fields as compared to satellite observations during daytime. The boundary layer potential temperature profiles are captured by WRF reasonable well at both urban and rural sites; the biases in these profiles relative to aircraft-mounted senor measurements are on the order of 1.5 °C. Changing UCMs and PBL schemes does not alter the performance of WRF in reproducing bulk boundary layer temperature profiles significantly. The results illustrate the wide range of urban environmental conditions that various configurations of WRF can produce, and the significant biases that should be assessed before inferences are made based on WRF outputs. The optimal set-up of WRF-PUCM developed in this paper also paves the way for a confident exploration of the city-scale impacts of UHI mitigation strategies in the companion paper (Li et al 2014).},

The results show that JULES is able to represent the observed Bowen ratios, but only when the additional anthropogenic water supplied into the urban ecosystem is considered. The impact of the external water use (irrigation, street cleaning), for example, on the surface energy flux partitioning can be as substantial as that of the anthropogenic heat flux on the sensible and latent heat fluxes. The Bowen ratio varies from 1-2 when the plan area vegetation fraction is between 30{\%} and 70{\%}.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Winter temperature inversions-layers of air in which temperature increases with altitude-trap air pollutants and lead to higher pollutant concentrations. Previous studies have evaluated associations between pollutants and emergency department (ED) visits for asthma, but none have considered inversions as independent risk factors for ED visits for asthma. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess associations between winter inversions and ED visits for asthma in Salt Lake County, Utah. METHODS: We obtained electronic records of ED visits for asthma and data on inversions, weather, and air pollutants for Salt Lake County, Utah, during the winters of 2003 through 2004 to 2007 through 2008. We identified 3,425 ED visits using a primary diagnosis of asthma. We used a time-stratified case-crossover design, and conditional logistic regression models to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate rate ratios of ED visits for asthma in relation to inversions during a 4-day lag period and prolonged inversions. We evaluated interactions between inversions and weather and pollutants. RESULTS: After adjusting for dew point and mean temperatures, the OR for ED visits for asthma associated with inversions 0-3 days before the visit compared with no inversions during the lag period was 1.14 (95{\%} CI: 1.00, 1.30). The OR for each 1-day increase in the number of inversion days during the lag period was 1.03 (95{\%} CI: 1.00, 1.07). Associations were only apparent when PM10 and maximum and mean temperatures were above median levels. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that winter inversions are associated with increased rates of ED visits for asthma.},

abstract = {The effect of urban development on local thermal climate is ostensibly well documented in scientific literature. Since the nineteenth century, observations of “urban-rural” air temperature differences ($\Delta$Tu­-r), or urban heat island magnitudes, have been reported for hundreds of cities worldwide. The historical and geographical scope of the heat island literature is impressive. Over time, however, methodologists have raised concerns about the rigor and authenticity of that literature, especially regarding the definition, measurement, and reporting of heat island magnitudes. Indiscriminate use of “urban” and “rural” by heat island investigators to describe their field sites is a particular concern. Much confusion now surrounds the physical and cultural characteristics of so-called urban and rural sites in heat island literature. This thesis confronts these concerns through two approaches. The first approach synthesizes and evaluates a sample of 190 observational heat island studies from the period 1950 to 2007. The synthesis uses nine criteria of scientific method and communication to critically assess the experimental quality of each study. Results are discouraging: the mean quality score of the literature sample is just 50 percent, and nearly one-half of the reported heat island magnitudes are judged to be scientifically indefensible on account of incomplete or incompetent reporting. The second approach develops a landscape classification system to standardize reporting of heat island field sites and temperatures in all cities. The local climate zone (LCZ) system comprises 17 zones and is the first comprehensive climate-based classification of urban and rural landscapes for heat island investigators. Each zone represents an area that is local in scale and unique in land cover, building morphology, and screen-level thermal climate. Results show that the new classification leads to a more purposeful interpretation of heat island magnitude as $\Delta$TLCZ, and thereby constrains the operational use of $\Delta$Tu­-r to climatologically defined and universally recognized urban and rural zones. The thesis concludes with a conceptual typology of urban heat island magnitudes, and a list of specific guidelines and recommendations to improve methodology and communication in heat island studies.},

abstract = {Satellite thermal remote sensing potentially provides a new way to monitor local climate change due to urbanization, especially changes in surface temperatures that result in the surface urban heat island (SUHI). However, this technique is restricted to clear-sky conditions. Because of this limitation, satellite-derived land surface temperature (LST) records are frequently interrupted, sometimes even becoming temporally sparse and, accordingly, climatically less representative. Given this challenge, we propose a strategy that incorporates an annual temperature cycle (ATC) model to perform temporal upscaling of the SUHI from a climatic perspective. Using two megacities (Beijing and Shanghai) as case studies, our major findings include: (1) urbanization tends to enlarge the amplitude of annual daytime LST series for both cities; (2) urbanization in Beijing narrows the diurnal LST range on annual average but broadens it in Shanghai; (3) within an annual cycle, the daytime SUHI intensity (SUHII) reaches its maximum one month later than the daytime LST maximum for Beijing, whereas this time difference is negligible for Shanghai; and (4) compared with the observation-based and moving-window-based temporal aggregations, the ATC-based temporal aggregation allows to produce a clear-sky SUHI climatology that is more representative and becomes potentially valuable for prediction or application purposes. From a climatic perspective, the temporal upscaling of the SUHI, therefore, provides insights into the impacts on local thermal environments that are induced by urbanization.},

abstract = {The causes and predictability of the California drought during the three consecutive rainy seasons (November-April) 2011/12 to 2013/14 are analyzed using observations and ensembles of simulations conducted with seven atmosphere models forced by observed sea surface temperatures (SSTs). Historically, dry California winters have most commonly been associated with a ridge off the west coast, part of a mid-latitude wave train having no obvious SST forcing. Wet winters have most commonly been associated with a trough off the west coast and an El Ni{\~{n}}o event. These attributes of dry and wet winters are captured by many of the models used in the current assessment. According to the models, up to a third of California winter precipitation variance can be explained in terms of SST forcing, with the majority explained by internal atmospheric variability. Nonetheless. SST-forcing was key to sustaining a ridge of high pressure over the west coast during each of the last three winters, and may have explained nearly one-third the CA precipitation deficits during the recent drought. In 2011/12 the forced component was a response to a La Ni{\~{n}}a event whereas in 2012/13 and 2013/14 it was related to a warm tropical west Pacific SST anomaly. All models contain a mode of climate variability that links west Pacific SST anomalies to a northeastward propagating wave train with a ridge off the North American west coast as part of its SST sensitivity during at least the last 35 years. This mode explains less variance than ENSO and Pacific decadal variability and its importance in 2012/13 and 2013/14 was unusual. The CMIP5 models project that rising greenhouse gases should increase California winter precipitation but that changes to date are small compared to the recent drought anomalies. As such, the recent drought was dominated by natural variability, a conclusion framed by a discussion of the differences between observed and modeled tropical SST trends over the past decades.},

@article{Baerwald2010,
abstract = {The drive to examine broad-ranging problems that encompass a complex mix of phenomena and processes has spurred the conduct of research that bridges traditional disciplines. Geographers have played active roles in many interdisciplinary projects, because geography itself is inherently interdisciplinary. Geography builds on major emphases in spatial analysis, human–environment interaction, and place-based and regional analyses to encourage communication and interaction with myriad other disciplines. The active pursuit of inquiries related to space, place, and interactions, especially dynamics within and across spaces and places, leads many geographers to range far from the field's core and explore the peripheral realms where geographic perspectives and insights intersect with those from other fields. Scholars who have engaged in interdisciplinary collaborations cite many positive aspects in working with colleagues from other fields, and they affirm their desire to conduct interdisciplinary work in the future despite the challenges they face when moving beyond comfortable disciplinary cores. Patience and open-mindedness are among the critical factors that foster success of interdisciplinary collaboration. Geographers should continue to show interdisciplinary leadership by embracing different perspectives, by supporting institutional arrangements that foster interdisciplinary activity, and by seeking the knowledge and techniques other fields can share at the same time they contribute geographic perspectives, approaches, and insights to the collective effort.},

abstract = {Estimating the distribution of impervious surfaces and vegetation is important for analysing urban landscapes and their thermal environment. The application of a crisp classification of land-cover types to analyse urban landscape patterns and land surface temperature (LST) in detail presents a challenge, mainly due to the complex characteristics of urban landscapes. In this article, sub-pixel percentage impervious surface areas (ISAs) and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) were extracted from bitemporal Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) data by linear spectral mixture analysis (LSMA). Their accuracy was assessed with proportional area estimates of the impervious surface and vegetation extracted from high-resolution data. A range approach was used to classify percentage ISA into different categories by setting thresholds of fractional values and these were compared for their LST patterns. For each ISA category, FVC, LST, and percentage ISA were used to quantify the urban thermal characteristics of different developed areas in the city of Fuzhou, China. Urban LST scenarios in different seasons and ISA categories were simulated to analyse the seasonal variations and the impact of urban landscape pattern changes on the thermal environment. The results show that FVC and LST based on percentage ISA can be used to quantitatively analyse the process of urban expansion and its impacts on the spatial–temporal distribution patterns of the urban thermal environment. This analysis can support urban planning by providing knowledge on the climate adaptation potential of specific urban spatial patterns.},

Focus was put upon on the examination of frequency, timing and duration of the Urban Moisture Excess (UME) ($\Delta$eu−r {\textgreater} 0 hPa). It was found that the urban site was more humid (0 hPa {\textless} $\Delta$eu−r⩽0.5 hPa; weak UME) in 31.4{\%} of the cases investigated and was only rarely significantly more humid ($\Delta$eu−r {\textgreater} 0.5 hPa; intense UME) in 4.6{\%}. Weak and intense UME occur during every month of the year with different frequencies per month. A diurnal course of UME was found for summer but not for winter. Weak and intense UME events show frequency maxima in the second half of the night. Most of them are characterized by durations of 1 hour, in few cases several hours duration were observed for weak (up to 14 h) and intense UME (up to 12 h). The main reason for formation of UME events might be that the surface dew point at the rural station was reached more often, earlier and lasted longer in comparison to the urban environment.

abstract = {The Montreal Urban Snow Experiment was dedicated to furthering the understanding of micrometeorological processes involved in the late winter-early spring transition period in a Canadian city. A surface energy budget (SEB) measurement site was installed in a dense residential area of Montreal for several weeks in 2005 and 2006. This paper focuses on the last 6 days of the 2006 experiment (23-28 March 2006), after snowmelt and before vegetation became active, with the objectives of providing a better understanding of physical processes involved during this transition period and examining their impact on the SEB. The Town Energy Balance urban canopy model and the Interactions between Soil, Biosphere, and Atmosphere force-restore land surface model are used in stand-alone mode and are forced with meteorological data measured at the top of a 20-m AGL instrumented tower. Preliminary results reveal deficiencies in the models' ability to simulate the surface energy budget partitioning, and in particular show overestimation of the sensible heat flux. Sensitivity studies indicate that a large portion of these problems is related to the latent heat transfer involved in natural soil freeze/thaw processes, which has a significant effect on the surface energy budget in this urban area. It is also found that the SEB in this particular situation is very sensitive to the thermal roughness length used for local energy exchange over the roof and road surfaces. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

abstract = {A recent publication extends previous findings on mortality associated with hot-weather episodes and reports estimates of average hot-weather-related mortality in 44 U.S. metropolitan areas. A geographic pattern emerges in the results: the highest hot-weather-related mortality rates are in northern metropolitan areas, even though average Summer temperatures are higher in southern metropolitan areas. This paper reports the results of regression analysis used to identify weather and socioeconomic characteristics of the 44 metropolitan areas that may explain the differences in hot-weather-related mortality. The results show that variability in minimum daily Summer temperatures may be one of the most important factors. This finding suggests that biological or behavioral adaptation occurs in areas that are consistently hot, but not where minimum daily temperature variability is greater. The results also suggest that differences in the availability of air conditioning, standards of living and housing quality contribute to differences in hot-weather-related mortality, but that these factors explain a much smaller share of the variation in hot-weather-related mortality than variability in minimum daily temperatures. The results suggest that whether climate change would result in higher hot-weather-related mortality may depend on the effect on the variability of minimum daily temperatures as well as on the change in absolute temperatures.},

abstract = {AbstractHourly surface temperature differences between Dallas–Fort Worth, Texas, metropolitan and rural sites have been used to calculate the urban heat island from 2001 to 2011. The heat island peaked after sunset and was particularly strong during the drought and heat wave in July 2011, reaching a single-day instantaneous maximum value of 5.4°C and a monthly mean maximum of 3.4°C, as compared with the 2001–11 July average of 2.4°C. This severe drought caused faster warming of rural locations relative to the metropolitan area in the morning as a result of lower soil moisture content, which led to an average negative heat island in July 2011 of −2.3°C at 1100 central standard time. The ground-based assessment of canopy air temperature at screening level has been supported by a remotely sensed surface estimate from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board the Terra satellite, highlighting a dual-peak maximum heat island in the major city centers of Dallas and Fort Worth.

abstract = {Climate change is arguably the great problem confronting humanity, but we have done little to head off this looming catastrophe. In The Perfect Moral Storm, philosopher Stephen Gardiner illuminates our dangerous inaction by placing the environmental crisis in an entirely new light, considering it as an ethical failure. Gardiner clarifies the moral situation, identifying the temptations (or "storms") that make us vulnerable to a certain kind of corruption. First, the world's most affluent nations are tempted to pass on the cost of climate change to the poorer and weaker citizens of the world. Second, the present generation is tempted to pass the problem on to future generations. Third, our poor grasp of science, international justice, and the human relationship to nature helps to facilitate inaction. As a result, we are engaging in willful self-deception when the lives of future generations, the world's poor, and even the basic fabric of life on the planet is at stake. We should wake up to this profound ethical failure, Gardiner concludes, and demand more of our institutions, our leaders and ourselves. "This is a radical book, both in the sense that it faces extremes and in the sense that it goes to the roots." --Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews "The book's strength lies in Gardiner's success at understanding and clarifying the types of moral issues that climate change raises, which is an important first step toward solutions." --Science Magazine "Gardiner has expertly explored some very instinctual and vitally important considerations which cannot realistically be ignored. --Required reading." --Green Prophet "Gardiner makes a strong case for highlighting and insisting on the ethical dimensions of the climate problem, and his warnings about buck-passing and the dangerous appeal of moral corruptions hit home." --Times Higher Education "Stephen Gardiner takes to a new level our understanding of the moral dimensions of climate change.

A correction is added in the buoyancy term of the TKE equation to improve consistency with the Monin-Obukhov surface layer theory. Obstacles of varying heights and dimensions are taken into account by introducing specific terms in the equations and by modifying the mixing length formulation in the canopy layer. The results produced by CIM are then compared with wind and TKE profiles simulated with a LES experiment and results obtained during the BUBBLE meteorological intensive observation campaign. It is shown that the CIM computations are in good agreement with the results simulated by the LES as well as the measurements from BUBBLE. The applicability of the correction term in an urban canopy layer and to further validate CIM in multiple stability conditions and various urban configurations is discussed.},

abstract = {A neighbourhood-scale multi-layer urban canopy model of shortwave and longwave radiation exchange that explicitly includes the radiative effects of tall vegetation (trees) is presented. Tree foliage is permitted both between and above buildings, and mutual shading, emission and reflection between buildings and trees are included. The basic geometry is a two-dimensional canyon with leaf area density profiles and probabilistic variation of building height. Furthermore, the model accounts for three-dimensional path lengths through the foliage. Ray tracing determines the receipt of direct shortwave irradiance by building and foliage elements. View factors for longwave and shortwave diffuse radiation exchange are computed once at the start of the simulation using a Monte Carlo ray tracing approach; for subsequent model timesteps, matrix inversion rapidly solves infinite reflections and interception of emitted longwave between all elements. The model is designed to simulate any combination of shortwave and longwave radiation frequency bands, and to be portable to any neighbourhood-scale urban canopy geometry based on the urban canyon. Additionally, the model is sufficiently flexible to represent forest and forest-clearing scenarios. Model sensitivity tests demonstrate the model is robust and computationally feasible, and highlight the importance of vertical resolution to the performance of urban canopy radiation models. Full model evaluation is limited by the paucity of within-canyon radiation measurements in urban neighbourhoods with trees. Where appropriate model components are tested against analytic relations and results from an independent urban radiation transfer model. Furthermore, system response tests demonstrate the ability of the model to realistically distribute shortwave radiation among urban elements as a function of built form, solar angle and tree foliage height, density and clumping. Separate modelling of photosynthetically-active and near-infrared shortwave bands is shown to be important in some cases. Increased canyon height-to-width ratio and/or tree cover diminishes the net longwave radiation loss of individual canyon elements (e.g., floor, walls), but, notably, has little effect on the net longwave loss of the whole urban canopy. When combined with parametrizations for the impacts of trees on airflow and hydrological processes in the urban surface layer, the new radiation model extends the applicability of urban canopy models and permits more robust assessment of trees as tools to manage urban climate, air quality, human comfort and building energy loads.},

abstract = {Whilst the measurement of radiation emissions from a surface is relatively straightforward, correct interpretation and proper utilization of the information requires that the surface area 'seen' be known accurately. This becomes non-trivial when the target is an urban surface, due to its complex three-dimensional form and the different thermal, radiative and moisture properties of its myriad surface facets. The geometric structure creates shade patterns in combination with the solar beam and obscures portions of the surface from the sensor, depending on where it is pointing and its field-of-view (FOV). A model to calculate these surface-sensor-sun relations (SUM) is described. SUM is tested against field and scale model observations, and theoretical calculations, and found to perform well. It can predict the surface area 'seen' by a sensor of known FOV pointing in any direction when placed at any point in space above a specified urban surface structure. Moreover, SUM can predict the view factors of the roof, wall and ground facets 'seen' and whether they are sunlit or shaded at any location and time of day. SUM can be used to determine the optimal placement and orientation of remote sensors to study urban radiation emissions; if the facet temperatures are known or modelled it can calculate the average temperature of the system, and it can determine the directional variation of temperature (anisotropy) due to any particular surface-sensor-sun geometric combination. The present surface geometry used in SUM is relatively simple, but there is scope to make it increasingly realistic.},

abstract = {Elevated summertime temperatures in urban 'heat islands' increase cooling-energy use and accelerate the formation of urban smog. Except in the city's core areas, summer heat islands are created mainly by the lack of vegetation and by the high solar radiation absorptance by urban surfaces. Analysis of temperature trends for the last 100 years in several large U.S. cities indicate that, since ??? 1940, temperatures in urban areas have increased by about 0.5-3.0??C. Typically, electricity demand in cities increases by 2-4{\%} for each 1??C increase in temperature. Hence, we estimate that 5-10{\%} of the current urban electricity demand is spent to cool buildings just to compensate for the increased 0.5-3.0??C in urban temperatures. Downtown Los Angeles (L.A.), for example, is now 2.5??C warmer than in 1920, leading to an increase in electricity demand of 1500 MW. In L.A., smoggy episodes are absent below about 21??C, but smog becomes unacceptable by 32??C. Because of the heat-island effects, a rise in temperature can have significant impacts. Urban trees and high-albedo surfaces can offset or reverse the heat-island effect. Mitigation of urban heat islands can potentially reduce national energy use in air conditioning by 20{\%} and save over {\$}10B per year in energy use and improvement in urban air quality. The albedo of a city may be increased at minimal cost if high-albedo surfaces are chosen to replace darker materials during routine maintenance of roots and roads. Incentive programs, product labeling, and standards cloud promote the use of high-albedo materials for buildings and roads. Similar incentive-based programs need to be developed for urban trees.

abstract = {Measurements of thermal infrared (TIR) directional anisotropy (difference between off-nadir and nadir brightness temperatures) performed over the city of Toulouse using a method based on the use of 2 airborne TIR cameras are presented. Results from 3 flights at different times during a summer day (July 15th 2004) and from 1 flight in winter (February 25th 2005) all confirm important anisotropy (up to 10 ??C) and hot spot effects as previously reported in literature. A simple simulation approach is then proposed. It is based on the aggregation in any viewing direction of 6 directional temperatures (sunlit/shaded walls/streets/roofs) weighted by their corresponding surface ratios within the scene viewed. The city is described by 18 canyon streets oriented in all directions by 10?? steps and the 6 temperatures are determined by integrating simulations of the energy balance model SOLENE repeated for the 18 canyon streets. The surface ratios are computed from images of the studied area generated with the POV-Ray software (Persistence of Vison Raytracer, http://www.povray.org/). This method is described in detail. The modelled anisotropy compares favourably with the measurements on all dates, despite a systematic underestimation ranging between 15 and 30{\%}. The possible sources of discrepancy including sensitivity to the aspect ratio and to the surface parameters and possible impact of microscale structures are briefly discussed and several improvements of the modelling system are suggested. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Yamamoto2005,
abstract = {Since their introduction 40 years ago, worldwide interest in urban climatic map (UCMap) studies has grown. Today, there are over 15 countries around the world processing their own climatic maps, developing urban climatic guidelines, and implementing mitigation measures for local planning practices. Facing the global issue of climate change, it is also necessary to include the changing climatic considerations holistically and strategically in the planning process, and to update city plans. This paper reviews progress in UCMap studies. The latest concepts, key methodologies, selected parameters, map structure, and the procedures of making UCMaps are described in the paper. The mitigation measures inspired by these studies and the associated urban climatic planning recommendations are also examined. More than 30 relevant studies around the world have been cited, and both significant developments and existing problems are discussed. The thermal environment and air ventilation condition within the urban canopy layer (UCL) of the city are important in the analytical processes of the climatic-environmental evaluation. Possible mitigation measures and planned actions include decreasing anthropogenic heat release, improving air ventilation at the pedestrian level, providing more shaded areas, increasing greenery, creating air paths, and controlling building morphologies. Further developments have and will continue to focus on the spatial analysis of human thermal comfort in urban outdoor environments and on the impacts and adaptations of climate change. Mapmakers must continue to share lessons and experiences with city planners and policy makers, especially in the rapidly expanding cities of developing countries and regions.},

abstract = {In Singapore, rapid population influx has led to demands for converting natural areas to pubic housing. The heat island in Singapore city has been documented. However, less attention has been placed on the cooling effect of city's green areas. To address this issue, temperature and humidity measurements were conducted in two big city green areas. One is the city's natural reserve - Bukit Batok Nature Park (BBNP) (36 ha) and the other is a neighbourhood park - Clementi Woods Park (CWP) (12 ha). The measurements were conducted at both vegetated areas and their surroundings. The results indicated the cooling effects of city greens are remarkable not only at vegetated areas but also the surrounding built environments. To further explore the role of the green area on moderating the microclimate, two simulation programmes, TAS and Envi-met, were employed, respectively, for the two parks. The aims are to explore the patterns of energy consumptions of a typical commercial building near to Bukit Batok Nature Park and different thermal conditions with and without Clementi Woods. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Temporal aspects of the urban heat island (UHI) of Vancouver, British Columbia, are demonstrated using differences of screen-level air temperature observed at an urban (downtown) and rural (farmland) site for three years. On an annual basis, the UHI is at its maximum near the middle of the night and its minimum is in mid-afternoon. Growth of the nocturnal UHI is driven by rural cooling rates in the early evening, which are much greater than the almost constant rates in the city. Growth starts earlier in winter. The largest UHI occurs in the fall, and the smallest in the spring. In daytime there is often a "cool island," especially in summer. There is an approximately inverse square root control of the UHI by wind speed and the effect of cloud type and amount follows the Bolt relation. Combining the two gives a "weather factor" that is linearly related to maximum UHI magnitude. Seasonal variation of the UHI is shown to be inversely related to the thermal admittance of the rural site, which itself is controlled largely by soil moisture status. This is done by calculating a "potential" UHI that is free of weather effects; a value that approximately conforms to that predicted by the SHIM numerical model. Surface wetting caused by recent rain, fog, or melting snow also is found to reduce UHI magnitude. While not quantified, marine advective effects appear to modify the UHI, especially the summer daytime cool island.},

abstract = {City size distributions, defined on the basis of population, are often described by power laws. Zipf's Law states that the exponent of the power law for rank-size distributions of cities is near −1. Verification of power law scaling for city size distributions at continental and global scales is complicated by small sample sizes, inappropriate estimation techniques, inconsistent definitions of urban extent and variations in the accuracy and spatial resolution of census administrative units. We attempt to circumvent some of these complications by using a continuous spatial proxy for anthropogenic development and treat it as a spatial complement to population distribution. We quantify the linearity and exponent of the rank-size distribution of spatially contiguous patches of stable night light over a range of brightnesses corresponding to different intensities of development. Temporally stable night lights, as measured by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Line Scanner (DMSP-OLS), provide a unique proxy for anthropogenic development. Brightness and spatial extent of emitted light are correlated to population density (Sutton et al., 2001), built area density (Elvidge et al., 2007c) and economic activity (Doll et al., 2006; Henderson et al., 2009) at global scales and within specific countries. Using a variable brightness threshold to derive spatial extent of developed land area eliminates the complication of administrative definitions of urban extent and makes it possible to test Zipf's Law in the spatial dimension for a wide range of anthropogenic development. Higher brightness thresholds generally correspond to more intense development while lower thresholds extend the lighted area to include smaller settlements and less intensively developed peri-urban and agricultural areas. Using both Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) to estimate power law linearity and exponent of the resulting rank-size distributions across a range of upper tail cutoffs, we consistently find statistically significant exponents in the range −0.95 to −1.11 with an abrupt transition to very large, extensively connected, spatial networks of development near the low light detection limit of the sensor. This range of exponents and transition are observed at both continental and global scales. The results suggest that Zipf's Law also holds for spatial extent of anthropogenic development across a range of intensities at both continental and global scales. The implication is that the dynamics of urban growth and development may be represented as spatial phase transitions when the spatial extent and intensity of development are treated as continuous variables rather than discrete entities.},

The term invites deeper considerations of its meaning, significance, and consequences for thought and politics. For this Forum, we invited five scholars to reflect on how the Anthro- pocene poses challenges to the structures and habits of geography, politics, and their guiding concepts. The resulting essays piece together an agenda for geographic thought – and political engagement – in this emerging epoch. Collectively, they suggest that geography, as a discipline, is particularly well suited to address the con- ceptual challenges presented by the Anthropocene.},

abstract = {The urban heat island impacts the thermal comfort of pedestrians in cities. In this paper, the effects of four heat mitigation strategies on micrometeorology and the thermal comfort of pedestrians were simulated for a neighborhood in eastern Los Angeles County. The strategies investigated include solar reflective 'cool roofs', vegetative 'green roofs', solar reflective 'cool pavements', and increased street-level trees. A series of micrometeorological simulations for an extreme heat day were carried out assuming widespread adoption of each mitigation strategy. Comparing each simulation to the control simulation assuming current land cover for the neighborhood showed that additional street-trees and cool pavements reduced 1.5 m air temperature, while cool and green roofs mostly provided cooling at heights above pedestrian level. However, cool pavements increased reflected sunlight from the ground to pedestrians at a set of unshaded receptor locations. This reflected radiation intensified the mean radiant temperature and consequently increased physiological equivalent temperature (PET) by 2.2 °C during the day, reducing the thermal comfort of pedestrians. At another set of receptor locations that were on average 5 m from roadways and underneath preexisting tree cover, cool pavements caused significant reductions in surface air temperatures and small changes in mean radiant temperature during the day, leading to decreases in PET of 1.1 °C, and consequent improvements in thermal comfort. For improving thermal comfort of pedestrians during the afternoon in unshaded locations, adding street trees was found to be the most effective strategy. However, afternoon thermal comfort improvements in already shaded locations adjacent to streets were most significant for cool pavements. Green and cool roofs showed the lowest impact on the thermal comfort of pedestrians since they modify the energy balance at roof level, above the height of pedestrians.},

abstract = {California is currently in the midst of a record-setting drought. The drought began in 2012 and now includes the lowest calendar-year and 12-mo precipitation, the highest annual temperature, and the most extreme drought indicators on record. The extremely warm and dry conditions have led to acute water shortages, groundwater overdraft, critically low streamflow, and enhanced wildfire risk. Analyzing historical climate observations from California, we find that precipitation deficits in California were more than twice as likely to yield drought years if they occurred when conditions were warm. We find that although there has not been a substantial change in the probability of either negative or moderately negative precipitation anomalies in recent decades, the occurrence of drought years has been greater in the past two decades than in the preceding century. In addition, the probability that precipitation deficits co-occur with warm conditions and the probability that precipitation deficits produce drought have both increased. Climate model experiments with and without anthropogenic forcings reveal that human activities have increased the probability that dry precipitation years are also warm. Further, a large ensemble of climate model realizations reveals that additional global warming over the next few decades is very likely to create ∼100{\%} probability that any annual-scale dry period is also extremely warm. We therefore conclude that anthropogenic warming is increasing the probability of co-occurring warm–dry conditions like those that have created the acute human and ecosystem impacts associated with the “exceptional” 2012–2014 drought in California.},

The height of the daily maximum temperature ZTmax varied with the season; ZTmax was at the roof level in winter but near the ground in summer. The seasonal change of ZTmax is likely due to the change of height at which solar energy is absorbed. At the time of the maximum temperature, the atmosphere above the canopy is always unstable whereas the air within the canopy is unstable in summer but stable in winter.},

abstract = {A methodology is proposed to analyze the radiative and thermal exchanges between a small urban neighborhood and the atmosphere based on the use of the thermoradiative model SOLENE and radiometric measurements to optimize the effective values of its constant parameters. Applied to the center of Toulouse, France, the optimization data are building surface temperatures measured with handheld radiometers and a downward-facing pyranometer during one of the intense observation periods of the CAnopy and Particles Interactions in TOulouse Urban Layer (CAPITOUL) experimental campaign. The quality of the simulations is assessed by comparing, without any other model adjustment, the model outputs for two diurnal cycles (1 day in summer and 1 day in winter) against two independent experimental datasets from fixed permanent radiometers and from sensors measuring the solar, infrared and sensible heat fluxes to the atmosphere at the top of a mast 30 m above the roofs. These simulations allow us to further analyze the separate contributions of the different surface classes, roofs, facades and pavement to these fluxes and to compare them with their counterparts observed over a neighborhood of Marseilles city center during a previous experiment. The partition is remarkably similar in Toulouse and Marseilles: 6–7{\%} for the solar radiation, 73–76{\%} for the infrared radiation and 17–20{\%} for the sensible heat flux. The contribution of roofs to the infrared flux appears proportional to their plan area proportion (built density) but not the contributions to the other two fluxes. The contributions of facades to all three fluxes are roughly proportional to their fraction of the total surface area.},

abstract = {All analyses of the impact of urban heat islands (UHIs) on in situ temperature observations suffer from inhomogeneities or biases in the data. These inhomogeneities make urban heat island analyses difficult and can lead to erroneous conclusions. To remove the biases caused by differences in elevation, latitude, time of observation, instrumentation, and nonstandard siting, a variety of adjustments were applied to the data. The resultant data were the most thoroughly homogenized and the homogeneity adjustments were the most rigorously evaluated and thoroughly documented of any large-scale UHI analysis to date. Using satellite night-lights–derived urban/rural metadata, urban and rural temperatures from 289 stations in 40 clusters were compared using data from 1989 to 1991. Contrary to generally accepted wisdom, no statistically significant impact of urbanization could be found in annual temperatures. It is postulated that this is due to micro- and local-scale impacts dominating over the mesoscale urban heat island. Industrial sections of towns may well be significantly warmer than rural sites, but urban meteorological observations are more likely to be made within park cool islands than industrial regions.},

abstract = {The 1995/1996 reintroduction of gray wolves (Canis lupus) into Yellowstone National Park after a 70. year absence has allowed for studies of tri-trophic cascades involving wolves, elk (Cervus elaphus), and plant species such as aspen (Populus tremuloides), cottonwoods (Populus spp.), and willows (Salix spp.). To investigate the status of this cascade, in September of 2010 we repeated an earlier survey of aspen and measured browsing and heights of young aspen in 97 stands along four streams in the Lamar River catchment of the park's northern winter range. We found that browsing on the five tallest young aspen in each stand decreased from 100{\%} of all measured leaders in 1998 to means of {\textless}25{\%} in the uplands and {\textless}20{\%} in riparian areas by 2010. Correspondingly, aspen recruitment (i.e., growth of seedlings/sprouts above the browse level of ungulates) increased as browsing decreased over time in these same stands. We repeated earlier inventories of cottonwoods and found that recruitment had also increased in recent years. We also synthesized studies on trophic cascades published during the first 15. years after wolf reintroduction. Synthesis results generally indicate that the reintroduction of wolves restored a trophic cascade with woody browse species growing taller and canopy cover increasing in some, but not all places. After wolf reintroduction, elk populations decreased, but both beaver (Caster canadensis) and bison (Bison bison) numbers increased, possibly due to the increase in available woody plants and herbaceous forage resulting from less competition with elk. Trophic cascades research during the first 15. years after wolf reintroduction indicated substantial initial effects on both plants and animals, but northern Yellowstone still appears to be in the early stages of ecosystem recovery. In ecosystems where wolves have been displaced or locally extirpated, their reintroduction may represent a particularly effective approach for passive restoration. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Human activities are affecting climate through increasing atmospheric levels of heat-trapping gases and other substances, including particles. 2. Global trends in temperature and many other climate variables provide consistent evidence of a warming planet. These trends are based on a wide range of observations, analyzed by many independent research groups around the world. 3. Natural variability, including El Ni{\~{n}}o events and other recurring patterns of ocean-atmosphere interactions, influences global and regional temperature and precipitation over timescales ranging from months up to a decade or more. 4. Human-induced increases in atmospheric levels of heat-trapping gases are the main cause of observed climate change over the past 50 years. The " fingerprints " of human-induced change also have been identified in many other aspects of the climate system, including changes in ocean heat content, precipitation, atmospheric moisture, and Arctic sea ice. 5. Past emissions of heat-trapping gases have already committed the world to a certain amount of future climate change. How much more the climate will change depends on future emissions and the sensitivity of the climate system to those emissions.},

Boundary-Layer Meteorology, 111, 109-132.] is modified to include a coupling of SUM with the actual building structure of a study area, thereby allowing variable building heights and shapes to be represented within SUM as well as the provision for an inter-building spacing that provides a more realistic urban block structure in the internal SUM urban surface representation. Model simulations using both modifications are performed and compared with airborne observations of surface temperature made over a Light Industrial area and a downtown area of Vancouver, BC. The results are generally good, although there is a general tendency to underestimate the overall thermal anisotropy. Use of mean facet temperatures in the validation limits validation statistics for one study area; improvements are made when facet temperatures are updated from individual flight lines. Performing a sensitivity analyses on the contributions to the thermal anisotropy suggests that surface structure and microscale temperature variability both make substantial contributions to the total anisotropy. This finding underscores the importance of including microscale temperature variability in assessments of urban thermal anisotropy. Full hemispheric plots of directional temperature and statistics for each study area are presented as an application of the model and show smooth variations in directional temperature when averaged over the study area. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Advection of the plume across the ceilometer occurred at a mean height of 250 m AGL. The plume traveled downwind at ∼3 m s−1, and at a distance of 8 km downwind, was ∼100 m in vertical thickness with particulate matter (PM) concentrations of order 30–40 $\mu$g m−3. Surface PM observations from surrounding urban monitoring stations suggest that the plume was not mixed to ground over the urban area. Plume trajectories at ∼250 m simulated by three numerical models all traveled to the northeast of the ceilometer location. Horizontal plume dispersion estimates suggest that the model trajectories were too far north to accommodate the likely lateral plume spread necessary to explain the ceilometer observations. This poor agreement between near surface observations and model output is consistent with previous mesoscale model validations in this region of complex urbanized terrain, and suggests that despite improvements in mesoscale model resolution, there remains an urgent need to improve upstream initial conditions over the Pacific Ocean, data assimilation over complex terrain, the representation of urban areas in mesoscale models, and to further validate such models for nocturnal applications in complex settings.},

abstract = {The cooling effects of urban parks, which form “Park Cool Island” (PCI), can help decrease land surface temperature (LST) and mitigate urban heat island (UHI) effects. PCI intensity largely depends on the characteristics of urban parks. The relationship between PCI intensity and urban park characteristics such as urban park size has been well documented. However, it is still unclear how urban forest structures in parks affect PCI intensity and particularly whether the relationship changes across seasons. In this study, PCI intensity for 33 parks in Changchun, China was obtained from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM) data and then correlated with urban park characteristics such as the size derived from “Systeme Probatoire d'Observation dela Tarre” (SPOT) satellite data and the forest structures of parks derived from the field-based survey to uncover the relationship between urban park characteristics and PCI intensity. Our results suggested that (1) The PCI intensity varied across seasons and the cooling effect of parks in summer was higher than that in autumn. (2) The increase of urban park size was still an effective measure to mitigate UHI. However, urban park size was non-linearly correlated to PCI intensity. (3) Not only by increasing urban park size, but also by optimizing urban park shape and forest structures in parks can increase PCI intensity. (4) The relationship between PCI intensity and urban park characteristics changed across seasons and seasons should be considered when exploring the relationship between them. These findings can deepen the understanding of PCI formation and provide useful information for urban planners about how to design urban parks to maximize their PCI intensity and mitigate UHI effects.},

abstract = {Urban environments can modify the local climate and are net CO(2) emitters, both of which can affect the life of an increasing proportion of the world's population that lives in and around cities. Observational information on the seasonal and diurnal variations of CO(2) fluxes (F(CO2)) as well as on the contribution from the different CO(2) sources and sinks is needed at fine spatial resolution to help develop and validate weather prediction and atmospheric dispersion models. This study reports on F(CO2) measured using the eddy covariance technique for a two-year period over a suburban and an urban residential area as well as a reference agricultural site located in the Montreal region, which experiences cold winters and warm summers. The seasonal and diurnal variability of F(CO2) and its response to incoming light and to air temperature was analysed. Typical weekday and weekend vehicular traffic CO(2) emissions (E(VT)) were estimated from inventory data for both residential sites. The urban site was a net source of CO(2) throughout the entire measurement period on the order of 200 t CO(2) ha(-1) year(-1). The suburban site was a winter source and a summer daytime sink of CO(2) resulting in a net source of 50 t CO(2) ha(-1) y(-1).Lower emissions at the suburban site are attributed to the large biological uptake in summer and to its low anthropogenic emissions. Higher emissions at the urban site are partly associated with its greater population and building density, promoting higher emissions from vehicular traffic and heating fuel combustion. The cold climate induced increased heating fuel combustion as compared to cities under a warmer climate. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This can increase photosynthesis and transpiration rates in the lower canopy and potentially decrease the ratio of sensible to latent heat for the entire canopy. Here, half-hourly and hourly surface fluxes from six Flux Network (FLUXNET) sites in the coterminous United States are evaluated over the past decade (2000-08) in conjunction with satellite-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) to determine if atmospheric aerosols systematically influence sensible and latent heat fluxes. Satellite-derived AOD is used to classify days as high or low AOD and establish the relationship between aerosol concentrations and the surface energy fluxes. High AOD reduces midday net radiation by 6{\%}-65{\%} coupled with a 9{\%}-30{\%} decrease in sensible and latent heat fluxes, although not all sites exhibit statistically significant changes. The partitioning between sensible and latent heat varies between ecosystems, with two sites showing a greater decrease in latent heat than sensible heat (Duke Forest and Walker Branch), two sites showing equivalent reductions (Harvard Forest and Bondville), and one site showing a greater decrease in sensible heat than latent heat (Morgan-Monroe). These results suggest that aerosols trigger an ecosystem-dependent response to surface flux partitioning, yet the environmental drivers for this response require further exploration.},

abstract = {This study evaluated how spectral resolution of high-spatial resolution optical remote sensing data influences detailed mapping of urban land cover. A comprehensive regional spectral library and low altitude data from the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) were used to characterize the spectral properties of urban land cover. The Bhattacharyya distance was applied as a measure of spectral separability to determine a most suitable subset of 14 AVIRIS bands for urban mapping. We evaluated the performance of this spectral setting versus common multispectral sensors such as Ikonos by assessing classification accuracy for 26 urban land cover classes. Significant limitations for current multispectral sensors were identified, where the location and broadband character of the spectral bands only marginally resolved the complex spectral characteristics of the urban environment, especially for built surface types. However, the AVIRIS classification accuracy did not exceed 66.6{\%} for 22 urban cover types, primarily due to spectral similarities of specific urban materials and high within-class variability.},

Low resolution data from MODIS sensor with high revisiting time have been used to analyze the daily variation of Land Surface Temperature (LST), the derived Surface Urban Heat Island (SUHI), and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) at city level. Medium resolution data from ASTER and LANDSAT 7 sensors have been used for spot assessment of the above mentioned parameters at district level. With medium resolution satellites, LST and NDVI have been analyzed in correspondence of different level of Impervious Surface Areas (ISAs) over the study period. With both datasets, the obtained results showed an inversion of the standard SUHI phenomenon during daytime, where the downtown areas appear colder compared to the suburbs. Throughout the study period, the trend has been replicated and seasonality is also observed, where the inversion of SUHI is accentuated mainly in the summer months with a daily difference of 5–6K compared to 2–3K during the winter season, while the standard SUHI can be observed during the night with values of downtown 2–3K higher than the suburbs. Spot analysis of single images confirmed this trend, adding the contribution of ISA to an average increment of 1K during winter and 2K during the summer.},

abstract = {Northwestern Canada is a genesis region of arctic air masses often considered to be formed primarily through radiative processes. However, the details of their life cycle are poorly understood. This paper examines the formation, maintenance, and dissipation of an intense and long-lived arctic air mass, using a thermodynamic budget analysis. The airmass formation is characterized by a deep-layer, multistage process that begins with snow falling into a nascent air mass. Radiative cooling from cloud tops begins the process. After the snow abates and clear skies are observed, the surface temperature drops rapidly, aided by the high emissivity of fresh snow cover, falling 17 degrees C in two days, creating an intense but shallow temperature inversion. Once the surface temperature falls below the frost point, ice crystals form. Afterward, although the surface temperature remains constant, the height of the inversion rises, as radiative cooling at the top of the ice fog layer decreases temperatures. During the maintenance phase, a cold-air damming structure is present with an anticyclone in the lee of the Canadian Rockies, low pressure in the Gulf of Alaska, and an intense baroclinic zone parallel to the mountains, separating warmer maritime air from colder continental air. The air mass persists for 12 days, undergoing several cycles of deep-layer weakening and intensification.},

abstract = {Land surface temperature is a key parameter for monitoring urban heat islands, assessing heat related risks, and estimating building energy consumption. These environmental issues are characterized by high temporal variability. A possible solution from the remote sensing perspective is to utilize geostationary satellites images, for instance, images from Geostationary Operational Environmental System (GOES) and Meteosat Second Generation (MSG). These satellite systems, however, with coarse spatial but high temporal resolution (sub-hourly imagery at 3-10. km resolution), often limit their usage to meteorological forecasting and global climate modeling. Therefore, how to develop efficient and effective methods to disaggregate these coarse resolution images to a proper scale suitable for regional and local studies need be explored. In this study, we propose a least square support vector machine (LSSVM) method to achieve the goal of downscaling of GOES image data to half-hourly 1-km LSTs by fusing it with MODIS data products and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) digital elevation data. The result of downscaling suggests that the proposed method successfully disaggregated GOES images to half-hourly 1-km LSTs with accuracy of approximately 2.5. K when validated against with MODIS LSTs at the same over-passing time. The synthetic LST datasets were further explored for monitoring of surface urban heat island (UHI) in the Los Angeles region by extracting key diurnal temperature cycle (DTC) parameters. It is found that the datasets and DTC derived parameters were more suitable for monitoring of daytime- other than nighttime-UHI. With the downscaled GOES 1-km LSTs, the diurnal temperature variations can well be characterized. An accuracy of about 2.5. K was achieved in terms of the fitted results at both 1. km and 5. km resolutions.},

abstract = {The relative performance of four independent methods to estimate the magnitude and diurnal behavior of net heat storage fluxes (△QS) in a city center is assessed. This heat flux is a significant but understudied component of the urban surface energy balance (SEB). Direct measurement of this SEB term at the local scale (horizontal length scale ∼102-104 m) is practically unattainable primarily because of the complex array of materials and the three-dimensionality of urban systems. Results of an 8-day summertime observational study at a site in the center of Marseille, France, are presented. This locale is an ideal environment for such research because of the warm, dry climate (hence the SEB is dominated by sensible heat exchanges) and the high density of tall buildings with thick walls (hence it has a large thermal mass that favors heat storage as a component of the SEB). Estimates of △QS derived as residuals in the SEB, after the remaining terms are measured directly, (termed RES) are compared with those calculated from a parameterization scheme [objective hysteresis model (OHM)], a local-scale numerical model [Town Energy Balance model (TEB)], and a bulk heat transfer method [thermal mass scheme (TMS)]. Inputs to the methods include observed meteorological data and morphometric properties of the urban site. All approaches yield a similar diurnal course. The OHM and TEB methods tend to slightly overestimate storage uptake by day when compared with the RES, whereas TMS slightly underestimates it. All methods underestimate heat storage release at night when compared with RES and show some sensitivity to wind speed, especially above about 5 m s-1. OHM estimates perform satisfactorily in the mean but miss short-term variability and are poor at night. TEB simulations show the best agreement with RES results, particularly at night. TMS values are comparable to those from the other methods, but its extensive input requirements render it almost impractical. Overall, the convergence of results is reassuring but the lack of a standard for quantifying heat storage and the spread of results mean this term remains a source of imprecision in urban energy balance measurement and modeling. {\textcopyright} 2006 American Meteorological Society.},

Potential synergies between VSWIR and TIR data are explored using analogous airborne data acquired over the Santa Barbara metropolitan region in June, 2008. These data were analyzed at both their native spatial resolutions (7.5. m VSWIR and 15. m TIR), and aggregated 60. m spatial resolution similar to HyspIRI. A spectral library of dominant urban materials (e.g., grass, trees, soil, roof types, roads) was developed from field and airborne-measured spectra using Multiple-Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) and used to map fractions of impervious, soil, green vegetation (GV, e.g., trees, lawn) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV). Land Surface Temperature (LST) and emissivity were also retrieved from the airborne data. Co-located pixels from the VSWIR and TIR airborne data were used to generate reflectance/emissivity spectra for a subset of urban materials. MESMA was used to map GV, NPV, soil and impervious fractions at the different spatial resolutions and compare the fractional estimates across spatial scales. Important surface energy parameters, including albedo, vegetation cover fraction, broadband emissivity and surface temperature were also determined for and evaluated for 14 urban and natural land-cover classes in the region. Fractions were validated using 1. m digital photography.Fractions for GV and NPV were highly correlated with validation fractions at all spatial scales, producing a near 1:1 relationship but with a {\textless} 10{\%} overestimate of GV from MESMA. Similar, high correlations were observed for impervious surfaces, although impervious was significantly underestimated in most urban areas and soil overestimated. Comparison of fractions across scales showed high correlation between GV and NPV at 7.5 and 60. m resolution, suggesting that HyspIRI will provide accurate measures of these two measures in urban areas. An inverse relationship between vegetation cover and LST was observed. Albedo proved to be highly variable and poorly correlated with LST. Broadband emissivity was far less variable with high emissivity surfaces ({\~{}}. 0.95) including vegetation, water and asphalt, and low emissivity surfaces ({\textless} 0.95) including selected roof types, beach sands and senesced grasslands. Residential and commercial areas showed a general pattern of increasing LST with increasing impervious fraction with the highest impervious fractions mapped in commercial areas, roads and roofs. Fine scale spatial structure in cover fractions and LST demonstrated important departures from a simple inverse relationship between GV and LST, even at 60. m. The results demonstrate the utility of HyspIRI data for urban studies and provide an insight of what will be possible on a global scale when HyspIRI data become available. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The increased temperatures of urban areas raise significant economic and health-related issues that affect more than half of the world population. This fact raised the need to assess and monitor the urban thermal environment and spurred the development of supportive information for decision-making, such as heat wave risk maps. Most of these require access to high spatiotemporal temperature measurements so as to be fully effective. However, even to this day, such datasets are difficult to obtain. Many remote sensing scientists support the view that the spatial enhancement of geostationary satellite land surface temperature data (LST) can provide the needed datasets. This approach has received significant attention in recent years and considerable progress was made in the development of relevant algorithms. The objective of this article is twofold. Firstly, to introduce the reader to the processing chain that leads to the production of spatially enhanced LST data, and secondly to highlight the exploitability of such datasets. This article presents these in the context of a service that the Institute for Astronomy, Astrophysics, Space Applications, and Remote Sensing of the National Observatory of Athens (IAASARS/NOA) is implementing, which aim is to operationally provide high spatiotemporal urban temperature data to several different end-users.},

In this study, we compared the eleven different indicators for quantifying surface urban heat islands that were most frequently used in recent publications on remote sensing-based urban heat island assessments.

We found that (i) the indicators individually reveal diurnal and seasonal patterns but show rather low correlations over time, and (ii) for single points in time, the different indicators show only weak correlations, although they are supposed to quantify the same phenomenon. Differentiating cities according to thermal climate zones increased the relationships between the indicators. Thus, we can identify temporal aspects and indicator selection as important factors determining the estimation of urban heat islands. We conclude that research should take into account the differences and instabilities of the indicators chosen for quantifying surface urban heat islands and should use several indicators in parallel for describing the surface urban heat island of a city. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {A consistent nomenclature for thermal infrared remote sensing of natural surfaces is outlined in this paper. Terms such as 'canopy temperature' and 'surface temperature' should be confined to general, qualitative descriptions and terms such as directional radiometric temperature, hemispherical emissivity, aerodynamic temperature, or hemispherical-directional reflectance used for technical precision. Some discussion also is included on the relation between hemispherical-directional thermal reflectance and directional thermal emissivity. A distinction is made between two kinds of emissivity; e-emissivity and r-emissivity. Through use of detailed models of directional thermal emissivity and bidirectional reflectance, we suggest that the influence of temperature gradients in vegetation on directional emissivity usually will cause uncertainties of less than 0.005. In addition, uncertainties that occur in estimating surface temperature, which arise because an ensemble of black bodies each at a different temperature does not have a black body radiance distribution with temperature, will not always be negligible for purposes of remote sensing of natural surfaces. Differences between mean thermodynamic and ensemble radiometric temperatures of 1 K or larger are possible even though differences in ensemble radiometric temperatures for different wavelength bands in the atmospheric window (8-14 ??m) usually will be less than 0.1 K. ?? 1995.},

abstract = {The first measurements of the energy balance fluxes of a dry, densely built-up, central city site are presented. Direct observation of the net radiation, sensible and latent heat flux densities above roof-top in the old city district of Mexico City allow the heat storage flux density to be found by residual. The most important finding is that during daytime, when evaporation is very small ({\textless}4{\%} of net radiation), and therefore sensible heat uses dominate (Bowen ratio {\textgreater}8), the uptake of heat by the buildings and substrate is so large (58{\%}) that convective heating of the atmosphere is reduced to a smaller role than expected (38{\%}). The nocturnal release of heat from storage is equal to or larger than the net radiation and sufficient to maintain an upward convective heat flux throughout most nights. It is important to see if this pattern is repeated at other central city, or dry urban sites, or whether it is only found in districts dominated by massive stone structures. These findings have implications for the height of the urban mixing layer and the magnitude of the urban heat island.},

abstract = {This paper presents an urban canopy and building energy model based on a thermal network of constant resistances and capacitances. The RC model represents the fundamental physical relations that govern the energy interactions between buildings and their urban environment, retaining the sensitivity to the design parameters typically used in building energy and urban climate studies. The benefits of the RC model are its simplicity and computational efficiency. It allows for better understanding the physics of the problem and makes it possible to easily evaluate modelling hypotheses and the sensitivity of different parameters. In this study, the RC model is evaluated against advanced simulation tools that are well accepted and evaluated within their individual scientific communities. The model is then used in a series of parametric analyses to investigate the impact of the Urban Heat Island effect on the energy consumption of buildings in configurations that are parameterized in terms of internal heat gains, construction, geometry, glazing ratio, and infiltration level. The RC model is also used to investigate the dominant mechanisms by which the indoor environment affects outdoor air temperatures. Parameters such as indoor air temperatures, exfiltration heat, and waste heat from HVAC systems are analysed. The conclusions obtained by this study can be applied to a wide range of urban configurations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The study of urban climate requires frequent and accurate monitoring of land surface temperature (LST), at the local scale. Since currently, no space-borne sensor provides frequent thermal infrared imagery at high spatial resolution, the scientific community has focused on synergistic methods for retrieving LST that can be suitable for urban studies. Synergistic methods that combine the spatial structure of visible and near-infrared observations with the more frequent, but low-resolution surface temperature patterns derived by thermal infrared imagery provide excellent means for obtaining frequent LST estimates at the local scale in cities. In this study, a new approach based on spatial-spectral unmixing techniques was developed for improving the spatial resolution of thermal infrared observations and the subsequent LST estimation. The method was applied to an urban area in Crete, Greece, for the time period of one year. The results were evaluated against independent high-resolution LST datasets and found to be very promising, with RMSE less than 2 K in all cases. The developed approach has therefore a high potential to be operationally used in the near future, exploiting the Copernicus Sentinel (2 and 3) observations, to provide high spatio-temporal resolution LST estimates in cities.},

The model has been tested successfully using observations from a monitored green roof in Florida. A preliminary set of parametric tests has been conducted on prototypical 4000 m2 office buildings in Chicago IL and Houston TX. These tests focus on evaluating the role of growing media depth, irrigation, and vegetation density (leaf area index) on both natural gas and electricity consumption. Building energy consumption was found to vary significantly in response to variations in these parameters. Further, this response depended significantly on building location (climate). Hence, it is evident that the green roof simulation tool presented here can serve a valuable role in informing green roof design decisions. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The role of net heat storage DeltaQS and anthropogenic heat QF are considered in the surface energy balance for a downtown area in {\&}Lstrok;{\'{o}}d{\&}zacute;, Poland, for a 2 year period. Eddy covariance measurements provide estimates of the turbulent heat fluxes and radiometric measurements of the net all-wave radiation. A method to determine DeltaQS based on representative surface temperature sampling is employed and compared with results from two other models. Results show that DeltaQS is an important flux on the scale of hours to days and that it can be more than 10 W m-2, on average, for periods of a week or more. By incorporating DeltaQS estimates over hourly intervals, QF was then determined as the residual of the energy balance. Using the approach, QF averaged 32 W m-2 from October to March (60{\%} of available energy), and -3 W m-2 from June to August. The physically unrealistic negative values for the summer period may suggest underestimation of turbulent fluxes, but no causal factor was identified. Although energy balance closure was close to 100{\%} throughout the year, there was weaker agreement in the winter. This is attributed to errors in estimates of DeltaQS and variation in QF. Results highlight the need for future investigations of the urban surface energy balance to incorporate more complete measurements and estimates of DeltaQS.

abstract = {Summary  During the Basel Urban Boundary Layer Experiment (BUBBLE) conducted in 2002, micrometeorological in-situ data were collected for different sites using a variety of instruments. This provides a unique data set for urban climate studies. Nevertheless, the spatial distribution of energy and heat fluxes can only be taken into account with remote sensing methods or numerical models. Therefore, multiple satellite images from different platforms (NOAA-AVHRR, MODIS and LANDSAT ETM+) were acquired, processed and analysed. In addition, a high resolution digital elevation model (DEM) and a 1 m resolution digital surface model (DSM) of a large part of the city of Basel was utilized. This paper focuses on the calculation and modelling of the ground (or storage) heat flux density using remotely sensed data combined with in-situ measurements using three different approaches. First, an empirical regression function was generated to estimate the storage heat flux from NDVI values second approach used the Objective Hysteresis Model (OHM) which is often used for in-situ measurements. The last method used information of the geometric parameters of urban street canyons, computed from the high resolution digital urban surface model. Modelled and measured data are found to be in agreement within �30 Wm−2 and result in a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.95.},

abstract = {In this paper, the effect of urban heat island is analyzed using the Landsat TM data and ASTER data in 2005 as a case study in Hong Kong. Two algorithms were applied to retrieve the land surface temperature (LST) distribution from the Landsat TM and ASTER data. The spatial pattern of LST in the study area is retrieved to characterize their local effects on urban heat island. In addition, the correlation between LST and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized difference build-up index (NDBI) is analyzed to explore the impacts of the green land and the build-up land on the urban heat island by calculating the ecological evaluation index of sub-urban areas. The results indicate that the effect of urban heat island in Hong Kong is mainly located in three sub-urban areas, namely, Kowloon Island, the northern Hong Kong Island and Hong Kong International Airport. The correlation between LST and NDVI, NDBI also indicates that the negative correlation of LST and NDVI suggests that the green land can weaken the effect on urban heat island, while the positive correlation between LST and NDBI means that the built-up land can strengthen the effect of urban heat island in our case study. Although satellite data (e.g., Landsat TM and ASTER thermal bands data) can be applied to examine the distribution of urban heat islands in places such as Hong Kong, the method still needs to be refined with in situ measurements of LST in future studies.},

It argues that one of the things holding physical and human geography apart for so long has been their relationship to physics as an assumed model of 'science'. It is proposed here that not only is this an inadequate model of science but that it has led us astray in our inherited conceptualizations of both time and space. The urge to think 'historically' is now evident in both physical and human geography. The paper argues that this both forms the basis for a possible conversation and also obliges us to rethink our notions of space/space-time.},

abstract = {The temporal and spatial distributions of boundary-layer ozone were studied during June 2000 at Summit, Greenland, using surface-level measurements and vertical profiling from a tethered balloon platform. Three weeks of continuous ozone surface data, 133 meteorological vertical profile data and 82 ozone vertical profile data sets were collected from the surface to a maximum altitude of 1400m above ground. The lower atmosphere at Summit was characterized by the prevalence of strong stable conditions with strong surface temperature inversions. These inversions reversed to neutral to slightly unstable conditions betweenB9.00 and 18.00 h local time with the formation of shallow mixing heights of B70–250m above the surface. The surface ozone mixing ratio ranged from 39 to 68 ppbv and occasionally had rapid changes of up to 20ppb in 12 h. The diurnal mean ozone mixing ratio showed diurnal trends indicating meteorological and photochemical controls of surface ozone. Vertical profiles were within the range of 37–76ppb and showed strong stratification in the lower troposphere. A high correlation of high ozone/low water vapor air masses indicated the transport of high tropospheric/ low stratospheric air into the lower boundary layer. AB0.1–3 ppb decline of the ozone mixing ratio towards the surface was frequently observed within the neutrally stable mixed layer during midday hours. These data suggest that the boundary-layer ozone mixing ratio and ozone depletion and deposition to the snowpack are influenced by photochemical processes and/or transport phenomena that follow diurnal dependencies. With 37 ppb of ozone being the lowest mixing ratio measured in all data no evidence was seen for the occurrence of ozone depletion episodes similar to those that have been reported within the boundary layer at coastal Arctic sites during springtime.},

abstract = {Objectives: To provide novel quantification and advanced measurements of surface temperatures (Ts) in playgrounds, employing multiple scales of data, and provide insight into hot-hazard mitigation techniques and designs for improved environmental and public health. Methods: We conduct an analysis of Ts in two Metro-Phoenix playgrounds at three scales: neighborhood (1km resolution), microscale (6.8m resolution), and touch-scale (1cm resolution). Data were derived from two sources: airborne remote sensing (neighborhood and microscale) and in situ (playground site) infrared Ts (touch-scale). Metrics of surface-to-air temperature deltas ($\delta$Ts-a) and scale offsets (errors) are introduced. Results: Select in situ Ts in direct sunlight are shown to approach or surpass values likely to result in burns to children at touch-scales much finer than Ts resolved by airborne remote sensing. Scale offsets based on neighbourhood and microscale ground observations are 3.8C and 7.3C less than the $\delta$Ts-a at the 1cm touch-scale, respectively, and 6.6C and 10.1C lower than touch-scale playground equipment Ts, respectively. Hence, the coarser scales underestimate high Ts within playgrounds. Both natural (tree) and artificial (shade sail) shade types are associated with significant reductions in Ts. Conclusions: A scale mismatch exists based on differing methods of urban Ts measurement. The sub-meter touch-scale is the spatial scale at which data must be collected and policies of urban landscape design and health must be executed in order to mitigate high Ts in high-contact environments such as playgrounds. Shade implementation is the most promising mitigation technique to reduce child burns, increase park usability, and mitigate urban heating.},

abstract = {Surface layer plumes, thermals, downdrafts and roll vortices are the most prominent coherent structures in an unstably stratified boundary layer. They contribute most of the temperature and vertical velocity variance, and their time scales increase with height. The effects of these multi-scale structures (surface layer plumes scale with surface layer depth, thermals scale with boundary layer height and the resulting roll vortices scale with convective time scale) on the surface temperature and ground heat flux were studied using turbulence measurements throughout the atmospheric boundary layer and the surface temperature measurements from an infrared camera. Plumes and thermals imprint on the surface temperature as warm structures and downdrafts imprint as cold structures. The air temperature trace shows a ramp-like pattern, with small ramps overlaid on a large ramp very close to the surface; on the other hand, surface temperature gradually increases and decreases. Turbulent heat flux and ground heat flux show similar patterns, with the former lagging the latter. The maximum values of turbulent heat flux and ground heat flux are 4 and 1.2 times the respective mean values during the ejection event. Surface temperature fluctuations follow a similar power-law exponent relationship with stability as suggested by surface layer similarity theory. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

@article{Zhao2014a,
abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI), a common phenomenon in which surface temperatures are higher in urban areas than in surrounding rural areas, represents one of the most significant human-induced changes to Earth's surface climate1, 2. Even though they are localized hotspots in the landscape, UHIs have a profound impact on the lives of urban residents, who comprise more than half of the world's population3. A barrier to UHI mitigation is the lack of quantitative attribution of the various contributions to UHI intensity4 (expressed as the temperature difference between urban and rural areas, $\Delta$T). A common perception is that reduction in evaporative cooling in urban land is the dominant driver of $\Delta$T (ref. 5). Here we use a climate model to show that, for cities across North America, geographic variations in daytime $\Delta$T are largely explained by variations in the efficiency with which urban and rural areas convect heat to the lower atmosphere. If urban areas are aerodynamically smoother than surrounding rural areas, urban heat dissipation is relatively less efficient and urban warming occurs (and vice versa). This convection effect depends on the local background climate, increasing daytime $\Delta$T by 3.0 ± 0.3 kelvin (mean and standard error) in humid climates but decreasing $\Delta$T by 1.5 ± 0.2 kelvin in dry climates. In the humid eastern United States, there is evidence of higher $\Delta$T in drier years. These relationships imply that UHIs will exacerbate heatwave stress on human health in wet climates where high temperature effects are already compounded by high air humidity6, 7 and in drier years when positive temperature anomalies may be reinforced by a precipitation–temperature feedback8. Our results support albedo management as a viable means of reducing $\Delta$T on large scales9, 10.},

abstract = {A small, but growing, number of flux towers in urban environments measure surface-atmospheric exchanges of carbon dioxide by the eddy covariance method. As in all eddy covariance studies, obtaining annual sums of urban CO2 exchange requires imputation of data gaps due to low turbulence and non-stationary conditions, adverse weather, and instrument failures. Gap-filling approaches that are widely used for measurements from towers in natural vegetation are based on light and temperature response models. However, they do not account for key features of the urban environment including tower footprint heterogeneity and localized CO2 sources. Here, we present a novel gap-filling modeling framework that uses machine learning to select explanatory variables, such as continuous traffic counts and temporal variables, and then constrains models separately for spatially classified subsets of the data. We applied the modeling framework to a three year time series of measurements from a tall broadcast tower in a suburban neighborhood of Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota, USA. The gap-filling performance was similar to that reported for natural measurement sites, explaining 64{\%} to 88{\%} of the variability in the fluxes. Simulated carbon budgets were in good agreement with an ecophysiological bottom-up study at the same site. Total annual carbon dioxide flux sums for the tower site ranged from 1064 to 1382gCm-2yr-1, across different years and different gap-filling methods. Bias errors of annual sums resulting from gap-filling did not exceed 18gCm-2yr-1 and random uncertainties did not exceed ??44gCm-2yr-1 (or ??3.8{\%} of the annual flux). Regardless of the gap-filling method used, the year-to-year differences in carbon exchange at this site were small. In contrast, the modeled annual sums of CO2 exchange differed by a factor of two depending on wind direction. This indicated that the modeled time series captured the spatial variability in both the biogenic and anthropogenic CO2 sources and sinks in a reproducible way. The gap-filling approach developed here may also be useful for inhomogeneous sites other than urban areas, such as logged forests or ecosystems under disturbance from fire or pests.},

abstract = {Urban parks can help mitigate urban heat island (UHI) effects and decrease cooling energy consumption in summer. However, it is unclear how park characteristics affect the formation of a park cool island (PCI). In this study, PCI intensity values for 92 parks in Nagoya, Japan were obtained from ASTER land surface temperature (LST) products and then correlated to detailed and use information derived from high-spatial-resolution IKONOS satellite data. The results indicate that (1) the cooling effect depends on the park size and seasonal radiation condition, and park size is non-linearly correlated to PCI intensity; (2) PCI intensity is mainly determined by the area of tree and shrub inside the park as well as the park shape, and grass has negative impact on PCI formation. The park vegetation and shape index (PVSI) proposed here well predicted PCI intensity of selected parks. These findings can help urban planners to understand PCI formation and design cool parks to counteract UHI effects. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Remote sensing of land surface temperature (LST) from the thermal band data of Landsat ThematicMapper (TM) still remains unused in comparison with the extensive studies of its visible and near-infrared (NIR) bands for various applications. The brightness temperature can be computed from the digital number (DN) of TM6 data using the equation provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). However, a proper algorithm for retrieving LST from the only one thermal band of the sensor still remains unavailable due to many diYculties in the atmospheric correction. Based on thermal radiance transfer equation, an attempt has been made in the paper to develop a mono-window algorithm for retrieving LST from Landsat TM6 data. Three parameters are required for the algorithm: emissivity, transmittance and eVective mean atmospheric temperature. Method about determination of atmo- spheric transmittance is given in the paper through the simulation of atmospheric conditions with LOWTRAN 7 program. A practicable approach of estimating eVective mean atmospheric temperature from local meteorological observation is also proposed in the paper when the in situ atmospheric pro? le data is unavailable at the satellite pass, which is generally the case in the real world especially for the images in the past. Sensitivity analysis of the algorithm indicates that the possible error of ground emissivity, which is diYcult to estimate, has relatively insigni? cant impact on the probable LST estimation error dT , which is sensible to the possible error of transmittance dt6 and mean atmospheric temperature dT a. Validation of the simulated data for various situations of seven typical atmospheres indicates that the algorithm is able to provide an accurate LST retrieval from TM6 data. The LST diVerence between the retrieved and the simulated ones is less than 0.4°C for most situations. Application of the algorithm to the sand dunes across the Israel–Egypt border results in a reasonable LST},

abstract = {The modeling and prediction of the stable boundary layer over land is a persistent, problematic feature in weather. climate, and air quality topics. Here, the performance of a state-of-the-art single-column boundary layer model is evaluated with observations from the 1999 Cooperative Atmosphere-Surface Exchange Study (CASES-99) field experiment. Very high model resolution in the atmosphere and the soil is utilized to represent three different stable boundary layer archetypes, namely, a fully turbulent night, an intermittently turbulent night, and a radiative night with hardly any turbulence (all at clear skies). Each archetype represents a different class of atmospheric stability. In the current model, the atmosphere is fully coupled to a vegetation layer and the underlying soil. In addition, stability functions (local scaling) are utilized based on in situ observations. Overall it is found that the vertical structure, the surface fluxes (apart from the intermittent character) and the surface temperature in the stable boundary layer can be satisfactorily modeled for a broad stability range (at a local scale) with the current understanding of the physics of the stable boundary layer. This can also be achieved by the use of a rather detailed coupling between the atmosphere and the underlying soil and vegetation, together with high resolution in both the atmosphere and the soil. This is especially true for the very stable nights, when longwave radiative cooling is dominant. Both model outcome and observations show that in the latter case the soil heat flux is a dominant term of the surface energy budget.},

abstract = {Thermal remote sensing has been used over urban areas to assess the urban heat island, to perform land cover classifications and as input for models of urban surface atmosphere exchange. Here, we review the use of thermal remote sensing in the study of urban climates, focusing primarily on the urban heat island effect and progress made towards answering the methodological questions posed by Roth et al. [International Journal of Remote Sensing 10 (1989) 1699]. The review demonstrates that while some progress has been made, the thermal remote sensing of urban areas has been slow to advance beyond qualitative description of thermal patterns and simple correlations. Part of the difficulty lies in the tendency to use qualitatively based land use data to describe the urban surface rather than the use of more fundamental surface descriptors. Advances in the application of thermal remote sensing to natural and agricultural surfaces suggest insight into possible methods to advance techniques and capabilities over urban areas. Improvements in the spatial and spectral resolution of current and next-generation satellite-based sensors, in more detailed surface representations of urban surfaces and in the availability of low cost, high resolution portable thermal scanners are expected to allow progress in the application of urban thermal remote sensing to the study of the climate of urban areas. ?? 2003 Elsevier Inc.

The authors call this the complete urban surface temperature. This temperature is not restricted by the viewing biases inherent in remote sensors used to estimate surface temperature over rough surfaces such as cities, Two methods to estimate the complete surface temperature are presented. Results for three different land-use areas in the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, show significant differences exist between the complete, nadir, and off-nadir airborne estimates of urban surface temperature during daytime. For the sites and times studied, the complete surface temperature is shown to agree with airborne off-nadir estimates of the apparent surface temperature of the most shaded walls. Some implications of using the complete surface temperature to estimate screen level air temperature and to calculate surface sensible heat flux are given.},

abstract = {Urban heat island (UHI) is a phenomenon of high spatial and temporal variabilities. It can develop during night or daytime. UHI monitoring is possible through thermal satellite remote sensing of land surface temperature (LST). LST over large areas (size of a city) can be measured at high temporal resolution merely from instruments on-board geostationary satellites. These can cover the diurnal cycle as they provide data even every 5. min (SEVIRI rapid scanning). Sensors on-board the geostationary satellites have, however, poor spatial resolution. Using high spatial resolution is in many regions most important because LST is a spatially inhomogeneous parameter especially in urban areas. UHI characteristics are correlated with the land cover and micro-relief parameters. These are often available in a higher spatial resolution (e.g. NDVI and EVI). Thus, we employed them to enhance the spatial resolution of the SEVIRI LST over central Europe - using moving window analysis - to 1000. m spatial resolution and temporal resolution of 15. min. For each SEVIRI pixel a multiple regression was run on the low resolution data. Regression equation was then used on the high resolution data in order to estimate LST of high spatial and temporal resolutions. The validation over urban areas showed that the downscaled SEVIRI LST is comparable with the MODIS LST with an average root mean square error of 2.5. K. The obtained results make possible to analyse the diurnal cycle of UHI. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Parks can create a cool island effect, adjust the urban microclimate, and improve the urban thermal environment. In the past, many researchers have utilized field measurements and numerical simulations to study the cooling effects and influential factors of parks. The current study is based on previous research on park cooling effects and utilizes an ENVI-met model to characterize the influence of the spatial arrangement of urban parks on local temperature reduction. The results indicated that different spatial arrangements of parks exhibited significant differences in outdoor cooling effects. A larger total park area, a greater number of parks, a greater area of the largest park, more evenly distributed park spaces, and more park diversity led to more dramatic outdoor cooling effects.},
